1;10460;11740;"Do you need something?"
2;11740;13740;"I heard that you're leaving tomorrow."
3;14270;16870;"You're abandoning the election and your son?"
4;16870;18490;"That bald fool!"
5;18930;21370;"Why did he tell her?"
6;21980;24160;"Why don't you stay and see this through?"
7;24160;26060;"We already know the election's outcome."
8;26060;28060;"I've had my fun."
9;28450;31860;"Meeting that Leorio guy was the best part."
10;32280;34380;"He shows a lot of promise."
11;34380;35960;"What are you talking about?"
12;35960;39300;"We're down to four candidates. 
We don't know the outcome."
13;39300;43270;"That's what I'm saying. 
See? You do understand."
14;124970;129980;"Approval x And x Coalition"
15;131780;134860;"I plan on voting for you today."
16;135220;136540;"See ya around."
17;138560;140860;"What in the world are you talking about?"
18;141470;142370;"Are you stupid?"
19;142810;146080;"I'm saying the outcome will be 
that there is no outcome!"
20;146080;148620;"Want to know how many days 
it'll be before this is over?"
21;148950;151130;"How can you possibly know that?"
22;151130;154540;"Because you and Mizai are in this to win."
23;155260;159870;"But if you really wanted to win, 
you should have tried harder before."
24;161190;163550;"You needed to use any means necessary"
25;163550;166750;"during the second or third 
votes to secure a majority,"
26;166750;169020;"and clear the turnout requirement."
27;169380;171190;"Why are you telling me this now?"
28;171190;173350;"It's easy to say whatever you want in hindsight."
29;173350;176350;"If I'd warned you beforehand, 
you'd have done the opposite."
30;176830;179030;"You're so difficult!"
31;179870;182540;"Well, I don't care if you think 
this is hindsight speaking."
32;183060;185160;"You can tell yourself that until the day this ends."
33;185910;187430;"Wait!"
34;187430;189200;"What do you want?"
35;192140;193920;"I'll do as you say."
36;194580;196120;"What should I do?"
37;196120;198670;"You don't sound too happy about it."
38;200970;203770;"I don't know what Pariston is thinking."
39;205420;207480;"How do I beat him?"
40;207480;212820;"Except you've never done anything 
I've told you to do..."
41;213570;218990;"Okay, I'll start with what Pariston's thinking, then."
42;220440;222450;"He doesn't want to win."
43;222950;225160;"But he doesn't want to lose, either."
44;225850;227530;"That's what makes him strong."
45;229600;232060;"What? How can that be?"
46;232060;233790;"Yeah, I know."
47;233790;240290;"Common sense tells you that people 
who want to win are stronger, right?"
48;240290;242930;"Nothing wrong with that. You're right."
49;243900;246180;"And being right makes you predictable."
50;246890;249170;"That goes especially for when you want to win"
51;249640;252560;"a game where you're trying to secure votes."
52;253750;255190;"Game?"
53;255190;258780;"See? You thought I was being disrespectful, right?"
54;258780;264200;"You're mad because you're big on morals, 
balance, and sticking to the manual."
55;265350;266970;"Look at me."
56;266970;269320;"You're failing to act like a dog."
57;269780;271200;"You're just being yourself."
58;272450;277200;"Pariston is familiar with both sides 
of you, so he knows that."
59;277560;281720;"He knows exactly what you're 
thinking and what you'll do next."
60;282860;285630;"And even then, he doesn't want to win."
61;285630;286970;"He's damn good, right?"
62;287210;289310;"Then what do I do?"
63;289310;290880;"I told you..."
64;290880;294810;"If I tell you what to do, you'll never listen."
65;295220;297480;"How many times must we go through this?"
66;298870;302990;"Okay, I'll tell you what happens 
if the game continues as is."
67;303780;307490;"First, you and Pariston will be the ones 
remaining after the next vote."
68;307810;311620;"In the two-candidate vote after 
that, first and second will flip."
69;313010;316250;"And that's what will keep happening."
70;318270;320750;"Pariston will probably try 
to lower the turnout rate."
71;321740;326510;"The Association Hunters he has 
control over will refuse to vote."
72;326980;328040;"Why?"
73;328340;329680;"Like I said..."
74;329680;332130;"He doesn't want to win or lose."
75;332580;334770;"He'll drag things out until the very last day."
76;335790;337840;"He's just looking to have fun."
77;338290;340170;"He's like Netero and me."
78;340520;343150;"Well, I get bored a lot more quickly..."
79;343920;345900;"But he has more patience."
80;346790;350280;"Of the four remaining candidates, 
Pariston is the only one"
81;351430;353160;"who carries on Netero's will."
82;354880;357410;"You have no right to say that!"
83;359900;361900;"You're only jealous of him."
84;361900;365670;"Were you that fond of the dirty old man?"
85;367120;368300;"Shut your mouth!"
86;368300;369800;"Don't get too full of yourself!"
87;370230;373310;"You just have to tell me the day 
when this election will end,"
88;373310;375310;"you stupid vagabond!"
89;377210;378810;"Okay, I can do that..."
90;379340;381760;"But before this is over, you 
should learn to act in character."
91;381760;383130;"You're impossible to talk to."
92;385240;387130;"The day Netero blew himself up,"
93;387870;391550;"one hundred large airships belonging 
to the Hunter Association"
94;391550;393450;"set off for East Gorteau."
95;394140;395800;"There's no record of their departure."
96;396440;399580;"All records show that they're 
in hangars for maintenance."
97;399910;401440;"You had no idea, did you?"
98;401980;405710;"You should make friends with 
some mechanics and pilots."
99;406270;408150;"What are you talking about?"
100;408780;411710;"They're recovering approximately 
five thousand cocoons."
101;412260;416120;"Cocoons containing chimera mutants."
102;417670;419580;"They all have the ability to use <i>Nen</i>."
103;420050;422780;"And they're all probably about to hatch."
104;423860;426400;"Pariston plans to have some fun with them,"
105;426840;429360;"now that he has such a huge playground."
106;430060;432610;"The day the election ends will be 
the day of the next Hunter Exam."
107;432960;436840;"However, if the Commandments are reformed,"
108;436840;439120;"the situation will change slightly."
109;440260;442200;"You'll have to figure out the rest yourself."
110;442710;443910;"Aren't you a Hunter?"
111;448620;454680;"Okay, we will now hold the eighth vote 
for the election of the 13th chairman."
112;455350;460520;"Today, we will start by listening to speeches 
from the four remaining candidates."
113;460900;465780;"After some debate among the candidates, 
we will move on to the vote."
114;467880;470030;"How did this happen?"
115;470930;473280;"Oh, I guess it's my fault..."
116;474370;476460;"Now, first,"
117;476460;480840;"we have comments from the 
candidates who did not qualify."
118;482370;487040;"First, I would like to thank everyone 
who supported me. Thank you."
119;487540;489250;"And if possible,"
120;489250;496300;"going forward, I would ask those who had 
faith in me to give your votes to Cheadle."
121;496780;500090;"The Zodiacs are not united."
122;500090;504700;"However, there are those among 
us who share very similar goals."
123;504700;507560;"And the one who shares my goal is Cheadle."
124;508260;515470;"Her desire to maintain balance will lead 
the Association in a better direction."
125;517910;520370;"{\fad(316,309)}Where you people are now is not 
my reality, so do what you want."
126;521660;524330;"{\fad(278,265)}Ging!! Don't try to run while you're 
ahead!! Get back here!!"
127;527110;531390;"We will now begin the speeches 
from the candidates."
128;531390;533720;"There is one thing to note."
129;534050;537220;"Everyone who's gathered inside the hall today"
130;537220;544480;"will be asked to stay until the 13th 
chairman has been selected."
131;567610;568880;"Anyone inside?"
132;569310;571030;"Only Tsubone and Canary."
133;594720;595760;"How's Master Alluka?"
134;596150;597570;"She's still asleep."
135;597570;599290;"I'm waiting for her to wake up."
136;606500;607790;"It won't be much longer."
137;608600;610400;"Just a little longer, Gon!"
138;639590;644200;"It's possible that we will 
continue to have multiple ties,"
139;644200;647620;"but we've arranged for all necessary provisions,"
140;647620;652760;"so you can rest easy repeating the vote as 
many times as necessary, be it for hours or days."
141;652760;654840;"Let me repeat myself."
142;655400;661090;"You may not leave this hall until the 
13th chairman has been selected."
143;661710;668540;"Now, we'll start with a speech from 
the candidate in fourth, Mizaistom."
144;670390;671560;"This is bad."
145;674910;678990;"To eliminate Pariston, I will 
serve as a sacrificial lamb."
146;680720;682210;"I'll make this quick."
147;682210;684480;"Of the four candidates on stage,"
148;684480;686870;"I believe the one most qualified to be chairman"
149;687660;689620;"is Cheadle."
150;691300;693770;"I won't say that I'm not willing 
to become chairman."
151;693770;695590;"But it isn't my time."
152;697220;701270;"First, I must train the Hunters under me,"
153;701270;704010;"and work to become a Triple Hunter."
154;705390;711020;"I would appreciate it if you'd respect my 
wishes, and help end this election today."
155;711930;713000;"That's all I have to say."
156;716090;717520;"What should I say?"
157;718190;722400;"Next, we have the candidate 
in third, Cheadle-san."
158;722400;723690;"All yours."
159;725260;727550;"I'll also make this quick."
160;727890;732290;"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the 13th chairman"
161;733410;735830;"should be Leorio."
162;738280;739420;"That's all I have to say."
163;742120;745600;"What is Cheadle up to?"
164;746760;749030;"I'm not gonna be elected."
165;749030;751680;"I don't even want to be elected."
166;752180;754570;"But I guess I should say what I want."
167;754570;757300;"My focus right now isn't this election, anyway."
168;758570;761320;"Okay... Thank you."
169;761320;765220;"Next, we have the candidate 
in second, Leorio-san."
170;765220;766340;"All yours."
171;768100;770950;"You aren't smiling anymore, Pariston."
172;771820;775710;"I won't let you have your way!"
173;776220;777200;"Huh?"
174;778190;782160;"Leorio-san, could you please speak?"
175;783830;785820;"Leorio-san!"
176;786890;788870;"Damn it, Leorio!"
177;788870;790600;"Are you asleep?"
178;790600;792840;"I'll strangle you!"
179;794180;796290;"Ah! Me?"
180;800620;803390;"Nope, I'm drawing a blank."
181;803390;806740;"What am I doing up here?"
182;807950;809800;"Forget it."
183;809800;811490;"In that case..."
184;814920;817120;"I'll just say what's on my mind."
185;817720;823260;"If elected chairman, I'll treat the 
Association like it belongs to me!"
186;827340;833770;"My first command will be to order 
all of you to help save Gon!"
187;837730;841740;"This isn't where I should be right now."
188;843290;849160;"Well, it isn't like I could help 
Gon if I were with him..."
189;850250;853410;"He's... Gon is fighting for his life now."
190;854040;857320;"He's a buddy. A friend."
191;859550;863300;"But I only found out recently."
192;864510;868740;"While I was studying for myself,"
193;869670;872290;"drinking, moving from place to place,"
194;873130;875520;"jerking off, entertaining women,"
195;876180;878440;"and surfing the Internet..."
196;880100;882070;"He was fighting for others."
197;882810;886130;"Alongside the former chairman and their allies."
198;888410;894740;"One of them has put his life 
on the line to save Gon."
199;896350;900680;"All I could do was talk to Gon."
200;901260;904460;"That's all I can do."
201;905360;910240;"So if I become chairman, 
I won't stop talking to you."
202;912910;915360;"Please help save Gon!"
203;915750;917130;"Use your heads!"
204;917130;918750;"If you have an idea, take action!"
205;920840;923240;"If there's something I can do, tell me."
206;923240;924550;"I'll do anything!"
207;929630;930360;"Ging..."
208;931530;934870;"I think I understand why you 
didn't avoid his punch."
209;936660;941250;"Even from that moment, 
you saw something in him."
210;945730;948700;"I'm fine with having him as chairman."
211;949640;954280;"Damn, I think I said more than I needed to."
212;954280;956160;"Forget the part about jerking off."
213;956780;957620;"I'm done."
214;963150;965330;"If we're there to support him,"
215;967480;971460;"I'm sure he'll make a good chairman."
216;977280;980900;"Finally, we have the candidate 
in first place, Pariston-san."
217;980900;982150;"All yours."
218;982880;985380;"Everyone, please be quiet!"
219;986340;988080;"It's over, Pariston."
220;988590;990880;"It doesn't matter what you say."
221;991270;995390;"My eighty-seven votes, 
Mizai's seventy-two votes,"
222;995860;998270;"and the fifty-seven independent votes"
223;998270;1001020;"will be added to Leorio's ninety-five."
224;1001610;1004100;"That gives him three hundred, eleven votes."
225;1004510;1007400;"He'll have over fifty percent of the vote."
226;1008250;1011400;"The 13th chairman will be Leorio."
227;1012070;1015080;"Everyone, please quiet down."
228;1015080;1017910;"Refrain from using mobile phones."
229;1019200;1023540;"Um, in a moment, I'm going to get loud."
230;1026190;1029850;"Everyone, you can continue 
talking on the phone."
231;1029850;1032340;"This is the true Hunter spirit."
232;1032790;1038240;"Once this election ends, I promise to 
do everything I can to help Gon-kun."
233;1039050;1044070;"However, we must keep that matter 
separate from the election."
234;1044070;1047190;"Of the remaining candidates, 
the one most qualified to be chairman"
235;1048370;1050190;"is Mizaistom-san."
236;1054440;1064460;"Heart <font color="#434340">Is Valuable</font>"
237;1055080;1056520;"There's something I've learned"
238;1056520;1060710;"after serving as Chairman Netero's 
Vice Chairman for three years."
239;1060710;1064460;"There are three conditions a chairman needs."
240;1064970;1066960;"First is combat ability."
241;1067380;1071330;"This is an absolute necessity, 
given our job requirements."
242;1071330;1073710;"During the recent crisis, this was evident."
243;1074310;1076220;"Second is experience."
244;1076740;1079460;"Wisdom comes from experience!"
245;1079460;1082850;"As a Hunter, you can never have 
too many years of experience."
246;1083750;1084850;"Why?"
247;1085680;1090110;"Why do I feel so irritated when he's talking?"
248;1090800;1093850;"And the third is caliber."
249;1093850;1095240;"I know why..."
250;1095240;1096520;"I understand him."
251;1097780;1101240;"He never says what he truly thinks."
252;1101240;1105320;"There aren't too many people who make you think"
253;1105320;1109290;"that the Association would be in good 
hands if they were chairman."
254;1109600;1111780;"Cheadle lacks combat ability."
255;1111780;1113750;"Leorio-san lacks experience."
256;1114010;1116630;"Stop... Don't let emotions get the best of me."
257;1117190;1120170;"And I lack all three!"
258;1120170;1122670;"Hey, you were supposed to laugh."
259;1123050;1126140;"I need to figure out what he's after."
260;1128120;1134650;"I believe that Mizaistom-san is the only 
one possessing all three qualities."
261;1135410;1140910;"One hundred and twenty of Pariston's two 
hundred ninety are Association Hunters."
262;1142550;1144750;"Thirty of the votes come from"
263;1144750;1149010;"the investigative and administrative 
departments he heads."
264;1149770;1152860;"Pariston is able to control those votes"
265;1152860;1155920;"as he likes without any signs or speeches."
266;1157530;1162200;"We will now move on to the 
debate among the candidates."
267;1163090;1165500;"Pariston's speech will create a split"
268;1165500;1169300;"among the independents, who were all 
most likely leaning toward Leorio."
269;1169710;1171440;"I'm guessing this is how it will look."
270;1171540;1179190;"{\fad(800,1)}Leorio: Leorio votes, Cheadle votes, Morel votes, Teradein votes 

Pariston: Association Hunter and Administrative 
Department votes, Pariston personal votes 

Mizaistom: Mizai votes, Pariston votes 

Cheadle: Mizai votes"
271;1173500;1176760;"But that would just push the 
election out another vote,"
272;1176760;1178700;"which matches our goal."
273;1180160;1184200;"Will something change during the debate?"
274;1189580;1192210;"Fine, then... I'll figure this out myself!"
275;1192810;1195030;"Can I go first, then?"
276;1195030;1197090;"No, I go first."
277;1197690;1201470;"As I said earlier, I'm not interested 
in becoming chairman."
278;1201470;1205770;"No, you said that you wouldn't say 
you're not willing to become chairman."
279;1205770;1209580;"However, this isn't about what you want, Mizai-san."
280;1210500;1213570;"What matters is how the voters feel."
281;1213570;1217830;"Sometimes, there are situations where a job 
can only be done by a certain person."
282;1217830;1219500;"That's where caliber comes in."
283;1220570;1223960;"You shouldn't be talking about how you feel."
284;1223960;1227650;"Stop the petty tricks, and let the voters decide."
285;1228180;1230300;"You have the nerve to say that?"
286;1231270;1233980;"But why is he pushing Mizai?"
287;1233980;1237280;"Does he expect us"
288;1237280;1240880;"to let greed get the better of 
us and push Mizai to second?"
289;1241670;1243920;"That will never happen!"
290;1243920;1246890;"Because the votes for Leorio 
are primarily independent."
291;1247250;1251870;"If Leorio loses, they're likely to swing to Pariston."
292;1252370;1254770;"But if Leorio remains,"
293;1254770;1259630;"the votes previously cast for myself 
and the openly anti-Pariston Mizai"
294;1259630;1261150;"will go to Leorio."
295;1261720;1265090;"He'll hold on to Teradein's anti-Zodiac votes,"
296;1265090;1267850;"and the Morel votes are also anti-Pariston."
297;1267850;1270510;"Meaning that they'll never switch to Pariston."
298;1272080;1274040;"Got it, Mizai?"
299;1274040;1275780;"Yeah, I understand."
300;1276530;1279610;"Defeating Pariston is the ultimate goal."
301;1280840;1283330;"As a Crime Hunter, I trust my instinct."
302;1283940;1288660;"There's no proof, and it's entirely possible 
that his hands are clean."
303;1289050;1290060;"However..."
304;1290970;1293710;"He definitely has underground ties."
305;1294340;1298020;"We can't let him run rampant within 
the Association any longer."
306;1299250;1304300;"Since it appears that not even 
Netero could rein him in..."
307;1306180;1308330;"This election is where we must..."
308;1309360;1311580;"...tear down Pariston's system."
309;1316700;1321860;"And so, the eighth vote for 
the 13th chairman begins."
310;1404800;1406130;"The votes fly."
311;1406130;1407450;"Is he defeated?"
312;1407450;1411890;"As Killua takes Something's hand, 
everything approaches its end."
313;1411890;1414940;"Next time: Defeat x And x Reunion."
