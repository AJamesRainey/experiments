1;9250;11730;"Th-Thank you very much..."
2;11730;13240;"Why did you not call for help?"
3;14410;15240;"Here..."
4;15570;16400;"And here..."
5;16800;17990;"You're covered in blood!"
6;22030;24640;"What is this creature?"
7;27010;28530;"What do I want"
8;30260;31620;"to do with her?"
9;112000;117090;"Taking Stock x And x Taking Action"
10;119750;122990;"One day remains before the selection."
11;122990;126730;"The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning."
12;136480;137610;"Good morning."
13;138350;140390;"You boys are up early."
14;142350;145120;"We have nineteen hours until 
midnight strikes on selection day."
15;145590;147160;"Tonight, we finally make our move."
16;147670;150120;"Let's do one final check."
17;151080;152320;"Once inside, Gon and I"
18;152320;156020;"immediately head up the central stairway, 
toward the throne room."
19;156690;157440;"Yep."
20;157850;158880;"Ikalgo will take"
21;158880;162600;"the northeast elevator down to the 
basement, to search for Palm."
22;164090;167320;"If you find her, escape without us."
23;167320;168140;"Right."
24;168800;172350;"If the King and his three Royal Guards 
are in the throne room,"
25;172350;174150;"we proceed with the plan."
26;174770;177530;"The problem is, what if they're not there?"
27;178260;180500;"You're really hung up on that..."
28;181200;184390;"What are the chances of that happening?"
29;184390;186900;"Well, it's highly unlikely."
30;187230;189450;"But the unusual happens pretty often."
31;189450;191540;"Aren't you contradicting yourself?"
32;192770;197320;"We researched the enemy's behavior extensively 
before deciding on a day for the attack."
33;197850;201430;"When you're waiting for someone to be 
in a certain place, at a certain time,"
34;201930;205800;"that's typically when the unexpected happens."
35;206540;208500;"In my old job, I saw this all the time."
36;208900;212470;"The unusual always happens 
on the day you've chosen."
37;213870;217050;"In my old job, I could wait for the next chance,"
38;217050;219570;"to ensure my success."
39;220600;222100;"But this time, that isn't an option."
40;222920;224370;"We can't wait."
41;224370;226330;"Once we move, there's no turning back."
42;226820;229720;"A moment's hesitation can mean death!"
43;230830;233080;"So we should take time now to decide"
44;233080;235460;"how we'll act in different situations."
45;236650;241070;"Even if they aren't in the throne room, 
if they're still in the palace, it's okay."
46;241640;246790;"Pitou's <i>En</i> is enough to cover the palace and 
its surrounding courtyards, and then some."
47;248260;254100;"So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter,"
48;254100;256390;"we'll know that they're there."
49;257450;261510;"From there, we just follow that 
sinister aura to where it feels densest,"
50;261510;263470;"and they'll be at its center."
51;265140;268680;"The question is what we do if 
we don't sense Pitou's aura."
52;269080;272360;"In other words, what we do 
if they aren't in the palace."
53;272360;276450;"Or if they're in the palace, 
but they aren't using <i>En</i>."
54;276790;278450;"Would they be in the palace,"
55;278450;281120;"but not using <i>En</i> to guard the King?"
56;281420;285500;"That's what happened when 
Knov-san infiltrated the palace!"
57;285500;286510;"Huh?"
58;286990;289390;"Yes, that's what I can't make sense of."
59;290320;293890;"According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura."
60;295260;298070;"The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side."
61;298070;302570;"So if Pouf was there, the other two were 
also in the palace with the King."
62;303680;307220;"Then, why did Pitou stop 
using the puppets and <i>En</i>,"
63;307220;309060;"leaving Pouf to handle security,"
64;309060;311640;"which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?"
65;312580;315590;"I believe the reason has to do with 
how Pitou's power works..."
66;316910;319600;"Then we should ask Colt."
67;319950;320720;"Yeah."
68;323100;326510;"I'd guess that during that time, 
Pitou was healing someone."
69;326840;327800;"Healing?"
70;328380;332060;"I told you that Pitou was the 
one who restored Kite, yes?"
71;333100;337060;"Thinking back, I don't believe Pitou 
used <i>En</i> during that period."
72;338170;341120;"Thus, healing must require a 
great deal of concentration."
73;341800;344320;"So while healing someone,"
74;344870;347570;"Pitou cannot use <i>En</i> or the puppets."
75;348920;350320;"Now it makes sense."
76;351080;352870;"Which means that someone,"
77;352870;356300;"most likely the King or one of the 
Royal Guard, was injured and"
78;356300;359200;"required healing, so the <i>En</i> 
and puppets disappeared."
79;359200;360710;"But hold on..."
80;361300;365710;"Who would have been able to 
injure one of those monsters?"
81;366100;367110;"True..."
82;367460;368960;"An internal dispute?"
83;368960;371870;"Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?"
84;371870;374220;"No, that's impossible."
85;374650;377860;"There is no chance that Pitou 
would endanger the King"
86;377860;381590;"by removing that <i>En</i> to heal someone else!"
87;382320;383800;"I guarantee it."
88;384240;386320;"Which means that the one injured..."
89;386860;388130;"...was the King!"
90;389960;392990;"I see... What you're saying makes sense."
91;393420;397500;"But then the bigger question 
is who injured the King."
92;398200;400330;"The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him."
93;400330;404750;"But other soldiers could never put 
so much as a scratch on him."
94;405100;408260;"Yep, so our conclusion was..."
95;409640;411240;"The King injured himself?!"
96;411770;414320;"Under what circumstances 
would that have happened?"
97;414320;417760;"We don't know why, but it's the only explanation."
98;421530;426550;"I'll admit that I didn't question our 
sudden stroke of luck too much..."
99;426950;431610;"But that chance was only possible 
under abnormal circumstances."
100;432890;435590;"Are they starting to lose control?"
101;436910;438260;"That isn't good..."
102;438640;441760;"I'm starting to think something's 
going on inside the palace."
103;445660;448170;"We will now begin moving to the palace."
104;449220;453910;"Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in 
Diego Plaza at once."
105;456590;460610;"The citizens of the other sectors 
should prepare to move out."
106;466390;468980;"Oh, they're starting to file out."
107;469340;471630;"They've begun their march..."
108;472240;475840;"Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts."
109;477450;480890;"In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three,"
110;481480;485060;"five million humans will fill the palace grounds."
111;486710;488520;"Has the situation in Peijing changed?"
112;488840;493010;"I thought it was only one skilled enemy, 
but now there are a bunch."
113;493500;496190;"So there are reinforcements."
114;497010;501650;"They may try to use the celebration 
as cover to approach us."
115;501650;504800;"Then the danger will be greatest 
during the selection."
116;505210;509630;"Yes, since the King will be 
participating in the selection."
117;511290;514010;"Our greatest concern is"
118;514010;517810;"the King somehow being taken beyond our reach."
119;519000;523650;"Assuming that they have a <i>Nen</i> 
user capable of translocation,"
120;524200;529920;"and that that person can use the ability 
to isolate the King somewhere else..."
121;531380;535090;"That means at least one of us must stay"
122;535090;537720;"by the King's side during the selection."
123;538050;539710;"The King won't allow it."
124;540170;544490;"As it is, he's been upset by how 
close we've stayed to him."
125;544950;547730;"Then we guard him secretly, 
without his knowledge."
126;548690;552780;"We need someone to stay just close 
enough to monitor his surroundings"
127;552780;556140;"while still carrying out his own role in the selection..."
128;557880;560650;"Whose size won't attract attention,"
129;561620;565000;"who won't get absorbed in an amusing task..."
130;565940;569760;"Very well, I am the best choice for this."
131;570390;573720;"Strictly by process of elimination, of course..."
132;577210;578320;"What's wrong?"
133;578840;582510;"Their presences have completely disappeared."
134;583820;587380;"I can't sense any residual aura."
135;587900;592050;"They must be using <i>Zetsu</i> to hide 
among the marching humans."
136;598090;599210;"Hey."
137;600810;602580;"There are so many people..."
138;603120;605460;"Around a hundred per building."
139;606060;607900;"They must have been packed inside."
140;608550;611470;"Then if we conceal our presences,"
141;611470;614500;"they can only assume that we're 
hiding among the citizens."
142;614930;618220;"Maybe they'll cancel the march?"
143;618670;619720;"No way."
144;620300;623970;"That would mean delaying or 
even canceling the celebration."
145;624370;628230;"Which would imply the King had 
accepted defeat and compromised."
146;628600;631460;"The Royal Guard won't let that happen."
147;632400;635340;"The celebration will begin as scheduled, 
no matter the cost."
148;635670;637670;"Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!"
149;637670;640500;"And that won't change."
150;643240;645050;"Once the humans began to move,"
151;645050;648410;"my puppets could no longer tell them apart..."
152;649510;652090;"Should I recall them?"
153;652090;656260;"No, giving the enemy free 
rein would be dangerous."
154;656960;663570;"Have the puppets join the soldiers that 
are guiding the citizens, as a deterrent."
155;679870;681070;"'Sup?"
156;681530;685820;"As expected, the puppets have joined the march."
157;686250;690520;"In another hour, those sectors will be deserted."
158;693920;698170;"There are six entrances to the 
rooms that lead to the palace."
159;699300;703090;"We'll avoid the entrances in front of the 
palace, where security will be tighter,"
160;703710;707320;"and wait by entrances A, B, 
and C, behind the palace."
161;708520;711510;"Once we've entered the rooms,"
162;711510;715480;"the only exit will lead inside the palace."
163;715750;717860;"What? You scared?"
164;717860;719060;"Don't be absurd."
165;719060;721110;"I merely want to be sure we're prepared."
166;721660;725530;"Waiting by the entrances involves 
quite a lot of risk."
167;726190;731350;"But if we enter the rooms too early, 
we won't be able to exit until midnight."
168;732110;733290;"True..."
169;733290;735840;"If we receive any useful information,"
170;735840;739130;"we want to be free to act on it..."
171;739450;742450;"And we can't use cell phones near the palace,"
172;742450;745240;"since the Ants will pick up on the signal."
173;745690;749830;"I think it's dangerous to spend hours 
waiting inside the rooms,"
174;750340;753770;"not knowing if there have been 
accidents or changes in the situation."
175;754220;758240;"But you're the one who said it was 
risky to wait outside the palace."
176;758240;759150;"Yes..."
177;759460;763340;"You shouldn't take their security net lightly."
178;763340;764680;"I'll take care of it."
179;766840;771910;"I'm the only one who can freely 
enter and exit these rooms."
180;772520;774460;"If anything happens, I'll tell you."
181;775880;778590;"For now, you should rest here."
182;778960;780300;"Will you be okay?"
183;780870;784270;"I shouldn't have any problem 
investigating the area..."
184;784740;789430;"Even if I'm right beside the palace, as long 
as I'm out of range of Pitou's <i>En</i>..."
185;792740;795190;"But you should be careful."
186;796530;799110;"Pitou doesn't use a standard circular <i>En</i>."
187;799360;803030;"It changes shape like an amoeba, 
giving it extended range."
188;804900;806820;"That's what Kite came in contact with."
189;807510;809860;"And it was probably deliberate..."
190;810230;814710;"It's a fighter's instinct to want to know 
how strong the opponent is."
191;815130;820850;"And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength."
192;822610;825240;"In some areas, that <i>En</i> can 
stretch two kilometers."
193;825910;827600;"Make sure you stay out of range."
194;828620;829890;"Don't worry about it."
195;830640;834930;"In this room, I'm the one who most fears them."
196;835420;837350;"I won't do anything crazy."
197;838720;840150;"I promise you that."
198;844880;847380;"We will now head to the palace."
199;847380;850950;"Any person who leaves their line 
will be shot on the spot."
200;851520;853450;"Move out!"
201;865370;866420;"Pitou..."
202;867330;871300;"You knew that Komugi was being attacked?"
203;871550;874480;"Yes, I was monitoring the area with <i>En</i>."
204;874830;875560;"However,"
205;875830;879570;"I determined that there was no threat 
to Your Majesty, so I ignored it."
206;880460;883440;"From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings,"
207;883440;885780;"and deal with any threats at once."
208;887070;889200;"Yes, as you command."
209;906940;909720;"Tens of thousands of people are marching"
210;909720;912390;"in a line toward the King."
211;913090;916370;"Like ants... No, lemmings."
212;916370;917910;"A march of death."
213;919090;922230;"It will be dark soon."
214;922690;925180;"I can tell Morel and the 
others to come out..."
215;930160;931550;"What is"
216;932590;934010;"that?"
217;939040;940220;"Wing scales?"
218;941230;946630;"The wind is carrying the scales of 
his wings toward the citizens..."
219;947110;948170;"That means..."
220;953280;954300;"As I thought..."
221;955490;959780;"They all look completely vacant and dazed."
222;960680;963630;"Those scales have a hypnotic effect."
223;966320;968690;"Stay in line as you advance!"
224;969270;970740;"Stay in line!"
225;971460;973810;"Once you reach your position, wait for orders."
226;973810;975370;"Do not move!"
227;976280;981370;"Simple orders delivered repeatedly, 
while tanks roll in the background"
228;981790;986030;"can easily seep into a mind exhausted 
from hours of marching..."
229;987200;990380;"It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!"
230;991670;996150;"Once the selection begins, 
and blood starts to fly,"
231;996150;999470;"they will continue to quietly stand in place."
232;1000070;1001710;"Until it's their turn."
233;1005780;1008230;"Hypnosis? I see..."
234;1008990;1012180;"If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run."
235;1012590;1015110;"But this works out for us."
236;1015110;1016070;"Eh?"
237;1016470;1018330;"If we make a lot of noise,"
238;1018330;1021600;"we won't have to worry about citizens panicking."
239;1021600;1022620;"Ah!"
240;1023290;1027830;"There won't be any stampede of humans 
falling over each other to escape."
241;1028330;1029880;"That's a big boon."
242;1030160;1037360;"Assuming that over half of the people 
will be in place at midnight,"
243;1037360;1042790;"we would have expected a stampede to 
leave tens of thousands of casualties."
244;1043050;1045520;"Our biggest concern has been addressed."
245;1046220;1048270;"We can go crazy."
246;1048920;1050900;"Six hours to go."
247;1054810;1056450;"Everyone's here."
248;1057020;1058830;"Have you heard from Palm?"
249;1059310;1060150;"No."
250;1062890;1063950;"Oh..."
251;1064470;1066900;"We'll keep waiting until half 
an hour before go time."
252;1067260;1070960;"If we knew what's inside before 
going in, it'd be very different..."
253;1071210;1072070;"Yeah."
254;1073400;1076000;"They both look composed."
255;1076800;1078780;"Killua, in particular, shows"
256;1078780;1082220;"none of the mental weakness he 
displayed when we fought."
257;1082460;1085320;"I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence."
258;1085710;1087830;"But for some reason,"
259;1088540;1092470;"he seems on the verge of fading away."
260;1094060;1097770;"No, I don't have time to worry about others."
261;1098480;1102870;"I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety."
262;1103710;1105760;"The fate of humanity rests on me..."
263;1108400;1110380;"Colt is a good guy..."
264;1111180;1114880;"Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts."
265;1115730;1120390;"It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants. 
Everyone has a heart."
266;1120390;1121900;"That's what I want to believe."
267;1122860;1124890;"Hopefully, the King also has one."
268;1126200;1130520;"But some of them must be killed..."
269;1131960;1133760;"If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!"
270;1134900;1137490;"Kite, it's almost time."
271;1137910;1141530;"I promise to turn you back..."
272;1143370;1145320;"By defeating that Ant."
273;1147470;1149090;"He's fired up..."
274;1149530;1151040;"I'll focus on providing support."
275;1151490;1154290;"So no one can interfere in your battle..."
276;1155550;1158510;"Using my new Kanmuru technique."
277;1159980;1161500;"My body feels heavy."
278;1162000;1164720;"I'm suffering from days without rest..."
279;1165120;1168180;"On a scale of 1 to 100, my current 
condition would be 40..."
280;1168180;1170890;"No, 35..."
281;1171620;1174330;"But I can't be whining now."
282;1174940;1177480;"With Knov out, I'm the only one left."
283;1178460;1180990;"I was hoping to fight at full strength,"
284;1180990;1184810;"but it's easier to accept my fate this way."
285;1185490;1190750;"I'll focus on playing the decoy and 
drawing my target from the King."
286;1193630;1196390;"I'm sorry, Morel and everyone..."
287;1198180;1200750;"But I can't bring myself to go."
288;1202720;1204850;"I'll take a look outside."
289;1212150;1216030;"So two minutes is the longest 
I can hold my breath..."
290;1216320;1221240;"Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit 
will probably be, at most, half that."
291;1222020;1223270;"Good enough..."
292;1223270;1224990;"One minute is more than enough time!"
293;1227580;1231300;"Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn."
294;1232290;1235750;"A few days ago, I couldn't have 
dreamed of such a life."
295;1236550;1238750;"Thank you, Killua."
296;1239850;1243480;"I promise to carry out my mission for you!"
297;1245190;1248300;"Tomorrow will be my birthday!"
298;1266070;1268280;"I am the King."
299;1270630;1273370;"But who am I?"
300;1275880;1279840;"Why was I brought into this world?"
301;1285330;1287430;"Time's up... Let's go!"
302;1304220;1305220;"Palm..."
303;1316850;1319870;"Ten minutes remain until 
they enter the palace."
304;1404880;1407140;"Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation."
305;1407140;1409180;"It's so cold, Gon..."
306;1409180;1411970;"They said Admiral Winter is coming!"
307;1411970;1414260;"I think you mean General Winter."
