1;2070;3140;"Gungi?"
2;3840;7760;"For the past fifteen years, 
there have been world tournaments,"
3;8420;11250;"and East Gorteau has yet to lose."
4;11890;16160;"Currently, they're on their third representative, 
a five-time reigning champion."
5;17880;21410;"Then, if I defeat this champion, 
I'll be the best in the world?"
6;21790;24250;"A fitting way to end this recreation."
7;25400;26710;"Bring them in."
8;109000;114000;"Check x And x Mate"
9;115890;120510;"Six days remain before 
Neferpitou begins the selection."
10;120510;124010;"The King has spent this time in his palace,"
11;124010;127980;"defeating the masters of shogi, 
Go, and other board games."
12;127980;131580;"The last remaining one, 
the reigning Gungi world champion,"
13;131580;133770;"has just been summoned to his side."
14;144430;146060;"U-Um..."
15;146060;149290;"Th-Thank you for infighting me—"
16;149290;150700;"For inciting me..."
17;150700;152170;"No need for small talk."
18;153180;155610;"You and I will play Gungi."
19;156140;159430;"Right now, I am learning the 
rules, so you must wait."
20;160420;165130;"Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader."
21;165650;167130;"He's dead."
22;167670;169440;"Now I am the King."
23;169730;172390;"I'm s-so sorry!"
24;172390;173940;"Please forgive me!"
25;174400;180790;"I'm only a fool, one who knows 
nothing of the outside world!"
26;180790;183780;"I can't even talk normally..."
27;183780;185830;"You are distracting me. Be silent."
28;186570;187580;"Or I'll kill you."
29;201990;204300;"Okay, I basically understand."
30;205800;206970;"Let us begin."
31;210420;211690;"What's wrong?"
32;213020;214690;"It appears she's passed out."
33;215520;218670;"After you told her to be quiet, 
she shut her mouth..."
34;218670;223580;"Then, since her nose was stuffed up, 
it seems she was unable to breathe."
35;224700;226950;"This is an uncommonly stupid girl."
36;227530;230700;"Yeah, that was embarrassing!"
37;231090;235830;"I can't even do things a baby can."
38;235830;238560;"My parents are always yelling at me..."
39;239810;241460;"Just play the game."
40;241460;241970;"Yes!"
41;242430;245330;"I'm honored to play against you."
42;259260;262760;"You can see with your eyes?"
43;262760;265290;"No, I can't see a thing."
44;265290;268490;"So would you please tell me your moves?"
45;269490;273030;"I only open them when I play."
46;273030;276490;"If it bothers you, I can try to close them..."
47;277050;278500;"I don't care."
48;282670;285760;"The atmosphere has changed."
49;292120;294640;"4-4-1, pawn."
50;299010;301610;"You can't reach him at all?"
51;301610;303900;"No, I guess his phone is off."
52;304580;308530;"We agreed that he would initiate all contact,"
53;308530;310530;"so I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
54;311010;315410;"Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?"
55;316570;321420;"Why does that guy look like he 
was born in the wrong decade?"
56;321970;327050;"And the look on his face says 
he's always looking for a fight..."
57;327920;329890;"The other has no eyebrows,"
58;329890;336030;"and that expression makes it 
clear that he trusts no one."
59;336030;339120;"It's not even a question of 
whether he and I can get along."
60;339120;344320;"I can already see he won't believe a word I say."
61;344900;349520;"Gon, I'm sorry to say that my 
first impression is very bad!"
62;349520;352460;"Unless I get some really good news soon,"
63;352460;356070;"there's no way I'll be able to trust them."
64;356070;357960;"I guarantee it."
65;365450;367460;"Hey, what's all this?"
66;367460;370670;"Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess."
67;370670;372350;"They have collars..."
68;372900;378840;"He's been feeding all the animals 
left behind due to the selection."
69;379490;381360;"He's even sacrificed sleep..."
70;381650;383360;"I'm not feeding all of them!"
71;383730;388360;"I know we don't have time to waste on that!"
72;388360;391600;"So I abandoned those that stood no chance."
73;391600;392830;"That's efficient, yeah?"
74;393290;396950;"Some were just skin and bones, 
but still wouldn't take my food."
75;397320;403280;"Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave 
their homes after I untied them..."
76;403280;407720;"What's so bad about saving 
the ones that want the help?!"
77;412640;415110;"You don't have to cry about it."
78;415110;417400;"I'm n-not crying, fool!"
79;417400;418980;"Want me to smack you?"
80;424480;427480;"That won't be enough to raise my opinion."
81;428820;431090;"Well, he certainly is different, though."
82;446610;449580;"7-8-2, spy."
83;449580;450760;"Checkmate."
84;452480;457810;"She's using an orthodox approach, 
stacking archers on her pawns."
85;457810;460020;"A standard strategy."
86;461030;463900;"Textbook execution."
87;464790;467780;"And her initial placement 
is one used with beginners."
88;468590;474030;"Meaning that I am not good enough 
for her to show her true skill."
89;476080;477280;"Another game."
90;478020;480410;"Yes, absolutely!"
91;487990;490650;"8-8-1, knight."
92;494310;495550;"I guess that's checkmate."
93;496110;501600;"You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader."
94;502630;507360;"I'll have to step up my game, 
or you'll get the jump on me!"
95;507770;510570;"That's enough... Go get some rest."
96;511820;515390;"That isn't necessary... I'm just fine."
97;515390;519120;"I can play Gungi for three days 
and nights without sleep!"
98;519120;521200;"I have another guest."
99;521200;524480;"Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn."
100;526740;530730;"Then I'll get a little rest."
101;542070;543940;"What do you think?"
102;543940;545850;"It's but a matter of time."
103;546720;548700;"There are more options to choose from,"
104;548700;551360;"but essentially, this game is 
no different than the rest."
105;552140;556240;"In four or five more games, she will 
have to use her real ability."
106;557430;560330;"Once that happens, I shall be 
able to observe her rhythm."
107;560330;562240;"Nothing has changed."
108;565360;566500;"Your Majesty,"
109;567490;570000;"the Go player hanged himself."
110;577190;580110;"Bring that idiot back."
111;589050;595000;"While the King continues to play 
against the Gungi master,"
112;595840;601670;"a short distance away, Morel has 
been using his power to surround"
113;601670;604790;"the capital city of Peijing."
114;611400;613420;"{\fad(295,1)}Purple Haze Soldiers 
Deep Purple"
115;611640;613420;"Deep Purple."
116;620470;623180;"First, he releases the aura that serves as a core."
117;624930;627920;"He then envelops it in an aura haze,"
118;627920;635750;"creating a smoke puppet that he can 
control at will via the <i>Nen</i> within the core."
119;635750;639450;"His ability can sustain two hundred 
and sixteen puppets at once."
120;641440;646930;"On the chance that the enemy retaliates, 
I've made my soldiers more responsive,"
121;646930;649960;"so I can only maintain fifty now."
122;649960;651960;"But they're much stronger."
123;653210;656980;"One advantage is that </i>En<i> can't differentiate"
124;656980;659260;"between one of these and a human."
125;661940;665480;"But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants."
126;665480;667820;"So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side."
127;667820;671840;"As expected, Neferpitou has recalled 
the controlled humans to the capital"
128;671840;674060;"to take up defensive positions."
129;674520;681070;"That implies the King's safety is top priority."
130;681940;685830;"Which means that restricting the movement 
of the Royal Guard is very easy."
131;685830;689830;"However, the question is how the King will respond."
132;690790;695590;"If we're dealing with a King who does as he 
likes, it'll be harder to anticipate him."
133;695590;698340;"And the risk of miscalculation increases."
134;699680;702970;"But as long as they keep 
these coming, we're fine."
135;711920;713230;"Long time, no see."
136;713900;715480;"I've been looking for you."
137;715880;718480;"Bah, he's gotten stronger."
138;719360;721850;"The air about him feels totally different."
139;722840;725870;"Knuckle's APR is gone?"
140;725870;728490;"It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either."
141;729050;733450;"If something had happened, 
Knuckle's group would have contacted me."
142;734650;737530;"If APR is gone,"
143;737530;740010;"<i>they have someone who can dispel</i> Nen."
144;740310;743830;"Or did he do it himself?"
145;746550;748640;"Let's see what they can do."
146;749250;751140;"Whichever wins..."
147;751140;753390;"In the end,"
148;753950;755490;"I will triumph."
149;756750;758400;"Time to return the favor."
150;759350;761780;"First, I'll beat you down."
151;763350;765330;"Then it's the pompadour's turn."
152;766370;769540;"His confidence is far from baseless."
153;770230;773390;"He must have gained a new ability."
154;773390;775170;"I wouldn't be so certain!"
155;778580;782670;"<i>If that ability is to exorcise</i> Nen, 
<i>we're in trouble.</i>"
156;783700;787820;"Knuckle and Shoot both use 
hit-and-fade fighting styles."
157;788380;792000;"Shoot does what he can to support 
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."
158;793160;797570;"<i>But we can't nullify their</i> Nen <i>with ours</i>"
159;797570;801370;"if they have someone who can dispel it."
160;802660;807490;"A strategy that might have worked 
against the King is useless now."
161;807990;808870;"However..."
162;809470;814980;"<i>if he has the ability to exorcise</i> Nen, 
<i>this is a good opportunity.</i>"
163;814980;818880;"If I neutralize him here, Knuckle 
and Shoot can use their powers."
164;822540;824090;"I must fight..."
165;824730;830390;"I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have 
to get by on my remaining aura."
166;837270;838900;"What?"
167;838900;842400;"He's still relying on speed?"
168;843140;847280;"There are plenty of ways to deal with 
someone who only uses speed."
169;848630;850660;"Now you're "It.""
170;851100;853160;"Huh? What was that?"
171;868260;870930;"Wh-Where am I?"
172;870930;872360;"A savannah?"
173;872870;875430;"Did he teleport me?"
174;875970;878250;"If this is his new ability,"
175;878250;880900;"<i>a different Chimera Ant is the</i> Nen <i>exorcist.</i>"
176;880900;882440;"That's bad."
177;882800;884690;"Sure you should just be standing around?"
178;886360;887570;"It's time to start"
179;887980;889640;"this game of tag."
180;889640;891570;"Tag?"
181;892300;895120;"We're in a field that I created."
182;895120;899330;"Unless you touch me, you can't leave."
183;904360;906260;"Your time limit is eight hours."
184;907270;909260;"Let's start!"
185;919600;920640;"Hey!"
186;921050;923510;"Didn't you hear what I said?"
187;923510;927150;"You can't leave without touching me!"
188;928070;931910;"If I chase you, I'll never catch you."
189;932510;935410;"So I'm going to take my time."
190;942160;944790;"Morel disappeared with the enemy!"
191;949730;952550;"Cheetu has activated his power..."
192;953230;958560;"I don't know what it does, but they 
won't be back for eight hours."
193;962620;964560;"The scenery is just a wall."
194;965180;970940;"Looks like I'm in some kind of space 
separated from the real world, like he said."
195;972240;976200;"Seems to be about the size of a baseball field."
196;976990;983210;"If I stopped Deep Purple, I could 
break out of here with ease."
197;983210;984550;"However..."
198;984550;989980;"First, is it even possible for me to stop 
Deep Purple from within this space?"
199;989980;993790;"Second, if I'm able to stop it,"
200;993790;997460;"will that aura return to me here, in this space?"
201;998030;1003740;"The worst scenario would be one 
in which I stop Deep Purple,"
202;1003740;1005840;"but the aura can't reach me in this space."
203;1007000;1009370;"Once Deep Purple is halted,"
204;1009370;1013630;"it can't be reactivated until 
I've recovered the aura."
205;1014160;1016740;"It's too risky to try."
206;1021390;1023870;"I can't stop Deep Purple."
207;1024360;1027130;"At least, not yet."
208;1027610;1029880;"Are you finally ready to start?"
209;1033300;1037680;"This way! Follow my lead!"
210;1043650;1046570;"Hold on, you aren't gonna..."
211;1046570;1049690;"You bet I am!"
212;1057830;1059300;"It's a waste of time."
213;1059300;1061660;"You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass."
214;1062510;1065540;"There's only one way out."
215;1065540;1068420;"And that's to catch me."
216;1070910;1072920;"I can tell that"
217;1073310;1076930;"Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy 
has weakened his power..."
218;1077860;1078920;"So then..."
219;1079920;1085010;"Hey, what happens if I don't touch 
you within the time limit?"
220;1085540;1086940;"Who knows?"
221;1087260;1089940;"I have no obligation to answer that question."
222;1090370;1092730;"Naturally, of course not."
223;1092730;1095790;"It appears there's more to this ability."
224;1096460;1098820;"I'm in for the long haul, then."
225;1101920;1104580;"Wake me up in five hours."
226;1106170;1107830;"Are you mocking me?"
227;1115060;1117380;"Go ahead, lose your temper."
228;1117380;1121350;"It seems you don't understand your own power."
229;1122440;1125350;"This isn't a battle of speed."
230;1126740;1129300;"It's a battle of mental fortitude."
231;1133300;1136380;"Deep Purple is still active..."
232;1141540;1143960;"So the operation continues."
233;1147120;1151880;"Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy."
234;1153290;1156990;"It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses."
235;1156990;1158380;"Anyone else around?"
236;1158730;1162890;"No, just the figures in white."
237;1163510;1167600;"Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers."
238;1167600;1172130;"But it's possible that the true leader 
is concealed among them."
239;1173520;1178280;"And I can't let anyone see my power."
240;1178850;1181960;"And Hirin is occupied with 
exorcising the </i>Nen<i> on Cheetu..."
241;1181960;1183030;"Damn..."
242;1183500;1186520;"I need at least two more pawns!"
243;1188590;1193520;"Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him."
244;1193520;1196550;"The King is nearly finished playing games."
245;1196930;1201120;"After that, the King will insist on 
defeating his enemies himself."
246;1201600;1206680;"We will be there to guard him, but 
you never know what might happen..."
247;1207210;1212190;"We would rather the King remain 
inside until the selection is over."
248;1214440;1216320;"Do you need something?"
249;1216320;1218750;"Give Leol a hand."
250;1218750;1221250;"Yes, as you wish."
251;1226900;1228280;"Well?"
252;1228280;1231450;"I am becoming worried."
253;1232700;1236320;"They've played many times, but 
the King is nowhere near victory."
254;1238790;1241330;"This player is a true master..."
255;1245040;1249040;"I should have been able to break 
her defenses from the left side."
256;1249040;1253850;"But she used a peculiar move 
sequence to turn the tables."
257;1256390;1258980;"4-5-1, musketeer."
258;1262700;1265610;"2-8-2, fortress."
259;1266560;1267620;"What?"
260;1268290;1271930;"The spy has done nothing this entire match..."
261;1271930;1274370;"But suddenly, it controls the board!"
262;1275700;1278630;"My right side's been destroyed."
263;1280390;1282580;"I'm done. That's checkmate."
264;1285160;1285880;"Impossible."

274;1407290;1409650;"Please go easy on us."
275;1409650;1410420;"Clack."
276;1410420;1411130;"Whack."
277;1411130;1412090;"Whoosh."
278;1412090;1413030;"Clang."
279;1413030;1414260;"Checkmate."
