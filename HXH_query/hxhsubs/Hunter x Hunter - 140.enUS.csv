1;2680;7010;"Something is skilled at destroying, 
but fixing isn't her forte."
2;9160;10490;"When she's fixing,"
3;11280;14550;"she must touch the target, 
or her power won't work."
4;16620;19330;"I will save both Gon and Alluka!"
5;102990;108040;"Join Battle x And x Open Battle"
6;147570;148680;"Impossible..."
7;149170;153090;"There's no way I can remove this!"
8;154310;156530;"My power is not enough"
9;157060;159970;"to bear this burden."
10;165030;165840;"Killua?"
11;166220;167980;"Where are you now? Are you okay?"
12;168600;170690;"Yeah, I'm on my way back."
13;171250;172980;"How'd it go with Gon?"
14;173980;175240;"No luck."
15;176250;178100;"When we told him about Kite,"
16;178100;180610;"there was no response on the monitors."
17;181320;185280;"A lot of people have dropped by to talk to him."
18;186540;188300;"But there's been no reaction."
19;188800;190250;"Right, I understand."
20;191210;193840;"I doubt we can heal him with normal measures."
21;194680;197160;"Wait! Don't be too hasty, Killua."
22;197520;201980;"As you said, Gon used a restriction 
and covenant to temporarily"
23;201980;204760;"wield an immense amount of <i>Nen</i>, right?"
24;205420;210140;"Then it's best if we let a 
<i>Nen</i> exorcist take care of it."
25;210480;214620;"We can wait until we've exhausted all our 
options to resort to riskier measures."
26;214980;219840;"Oh, sorry. That didn't come out right."
27;220520;224530;"I'm not talking about taking a crazy gamble."
28;224950;228760;"In fact, I can guarantee Gon will be healed."
29;229520;230580;"Let me take care of this."
30;231140;234540;"This method isn't as risky as using a <i>Nen</i> exorcist."
31;236710;239980;"But the problem is how I can get there."
32;240730;244550;"This time, that will be the biggest challenge."
33;245170;246730;"Wh-What do you—"
34;248570;251100;"Forgive me, Master Killua."
35;251870;253060;"Is that you, Gotoh?"
36;253310;257560;"I can't let you continue that conversation, 
on the grounds of secrecy."
37;258050;260030;"I didn't tell him anything secret!"
38;260630;261480;"Not true."
39;262110;264730;"You said you could guarantee Gon would be healed."
40;264730;267240;"That was a reference to Master Alluka's power."
41;267860;270760;"At the moment, you are still 
just within Zoldyck property,"
42;271350;277540;"but outside the boundaries, you are already 
at alert level 4, so please be careful."
43;278790;283280;"So he was waiting for me to give Morel a hint?"
44;284310;286420;"You're too easy on me, Gotoh."
45;286990;290060;"I do not understand what you mean."
46;291240;292580;"Level 4..."
47;293120;295690;"Looks like I pissed off my father."
48;297720;300110;"When one's outside alert level is 4,"
49;300560;303400;"restrictions are placed upon 
what the target can do and say."
50;303400;305120;"To enforce this restriction,"
51;305120;308700;"multiple butlers and family members 
are assigned to monitor the target."
52;308090;311720;"<font color="#eefc53">Restricted</font>"
53;309400;311620;"If a restriction is violated,"
54;311620;314580;"the target will immediately be 
captured and returned home,"
55;311720;318600;"<font color="#db1d32">Restricted</font>"
56;314580;318080;"and the alert will automatically increase to level 5."
57;319060;320250;"At level 5,"
58;320650;324910;"the moment a single step is 
taken outside Zoldyck property,"
59;324910;326510;"the target is captured."
60;328550;329620;"What's the reason?"
61;330300;334410;"The reasons are unauthorized 
removal of a classified object,"
62;334410;338300;"rebelling against your parents, 
and use of threatening actions."
63;338300;339680;"Alluka's an object?"
64;340050;342360;"There are three restrictions."
65;342800;345560;"First, to protect family secrets,"
66;345560;348800;"the target may not speak to,"
67;348800;352370;"or exchange items with, 
any outsiders without permission."
68;353390;357550;"To enforce this, the target is forbidden 
to carry any communication devices."
69;358070;360470;"I've already had everything taken away."
70;360980;363620;"Second, to protect family secrets,"
71;363620;368610;"the target must stay within one meter 
of Master Alluka at all times."
72;369080;370150;"Yeah, yeah."
73;370150;371760;"I don't plan on letting her out of my sight."
74;372510;375150;"Third, to protect family secrets,"
75;375150;378780;"you are forbidden from letting any outsiders"
76;378780;381400;"learn anything about Alluka's power."
77;383200;384780;"I understand perfectly."
78;385210;386650;"So basically..."
79;391380;393160;"This is what I have to do."
80;393950;397530;"This way, I don't have to ask permission 
every time I do something."
81;397960;401460;"While we're traveling, I'll let you 
handle all the arrangements!"
82;402630;404510;"I understand why I am here."
83;404980;406920;"But why is Canary here?"
84;407130;408250;"Moron!"
85;408710;410300;"Alluka's a girl."
86;410700;414560;"I can't trust a lump like you to take care of her!"
87;415000;417060;"There is nothing to worry about."
88;422580;425820;"We shall also accompany you."
89;426360;430130;"Master Silva did not believe"
90;430130;433320;"that two butlers would be enough."
91;433930;435020;"Tsubone!"
92;444680;447340;"Dad really is pissed..."
93;448290;449590;"It's fine."
94;450010;452530;"I won't do anything stupid at alert level 4."
95;454930;457000;"Listen to me, Killua-chan."
96;458150;463230;"I'm not as lenient as your father and Gotoh."
97;463630;465660;"A single violation, and I'll take you home."
98;465660;468440;"Nothing will change that."
99;470010;472280;"If you resist, I'll knock you out."
100;473080;475530;"Keep that in mind."
101;475900;477220;"Are we clear?"
102;477810;479500;"Yes! Yes! Yes!"
103;482230;484880;"Tsubone-sensei is the only person"
104;484880;488060;"in the entire household who 
calls Master Killua "Killua-chan.""
105;489530;491760;"No bullying Brother."
106;494610;496490;"I'm sorry..."
107;496490;499500;"Alluka-chama is so kind."
108;499500;501270;"I won't do it again."
109;502090;503530;"I just realized something."
110;503840;506770;"I have trouble dealing with old ladies."
111;508540;510200;"Do you love your big brother?"
112;510690;511780;"I love him lots!"
113;512450;515700;"Then you should do as he says."
114;516300;517540;"Okay!"
115;518300;521380;"Master Killua is depending on me."
116;522020;523760;"All so he can save his friend,"
117;524820;526190;"regardless of the risks."
118;527680;528830;"I will help him!"
119;529590;531290;"Even if it costs me this job"
120;532060;534290;"or my life."
121;538370;540400;"I am Amane. It's a pleasure."
122;543410;544410;"Canary."
123;544840;545960;"The pleasure's mine."
124;546710;547810;"Tsubone!"
125;549880;552610;"Give me the nail of your pinky."
126;560180;561710;"She made a request of Tsubone!"
127;562330;564010;"This is the worst time for it!"
128;565070;569770;"Even I don't know when, and of whom, 
Something's requests will come."
129;578250;581100;"Yes, absolutely."
130;597390;598880;"Master Killua,"
131;598880;601870;"I will go into hiding for the time being."
132;603090;605930;"This means that Master Alluka"
133;605930;609630;"will not make requests of anyone else."
134;610640;612480;"Unless I change my mind."
135;612930;615730;"Do you understand what I mean?"
136;616840;621320;"Of course, I will remain near you at all times."
137;623510;625640;"I still have more requests..."
138;629740;630900;"She pulled a fast one!"
139;632730;633900;"It's all right."
140;634420;636270;"I still have a chance."
141;636830;639920;"I won't be able to make a wish, 
but I can issue a command!"
142;644890;648040;"Brother, are you angry?"
143;655690;656800;"It's okay."
144;657590;660300;"There's nothing for you to worry about."
145;661090;664350;"I will save you!"
146;677640;678610;"Yes?"
147;679170;680010;"Yes."
148;681020;681990;"Yes."
149;682990;683970;"That's right."
150;684800;687140;"This is Master Killua's phone."
151;689050;691740;"No, I cannot answer that question."
152;693490;695490;"I cannot answer that question, either."
153;697370;699120;"In that case,"
154;699610;702960;"you should state your name first."
155;703540;704710;"Goodbye."
156;705850;706870;"Who was that?"
157;706870;707920;"It was..."
158;710870;711640;"Hello?"
159;714630;718150;"My name is Leorio!"
160;718860;722840;"Can you put Killua-kun on the phone?"
161;723580;724910;"Shh!"
162;725370;727660;"Wow, that brings back memories!"
163;728570;731440;"It has been quite some time, Master Leorio."
164;731770;732680;"Huh?"
165;733370;734830;"Oh! I remember!"
166;734830;736060;"It's the coin guy!"
167;736470;741120;"Master Killua is currently on his way 
there, accompanied by us."
168;742190;745310;"Yes, to help Master Gon."
169;745970;750140;"However, there are strict conditions 
that must be met."
170;750140;751430;"Hey, there..."
171;751670;753780;"Conditions to save a friend?"
172;753780;755190;"Are you dreaming?"
173;755450;759060;"If you need help waking up, 
I'll speak more loudly!"
174;759780;761760;"Keep your mouth shut."
175;761760;763490;"What did you say?"
176;764180;766490;"Master Killua is risking his life."
177;767620;771180;"He's heading to you, against his family's wishes."
178;771640;775120;"You should know that the Zoldyck 
family is very special."
179;775850;778160;"We are the ones who set the conditions."
180;778820;780810;"So shut up and listen, fool."
181;781110;782130;"Gotoh..."
182;785000;787260;"Please excuse me."
183;787810;788990;"Let me talk to him."
184;788990;790320;"It'll be faster that way."
185;791610;792890;"Don't worry."
186;792890;794830;"I won't say anything I'm not supposed to."
187;795520;797620;"One violation, and I'll be sent home, right?"
188;798790;800250;"Yo, it's been a while."
189;800730;801650;"Killua!"
190;801980;804950;"When you get here, let me talk to that guy."
191;804950;806450;"Are you okay?"
192;806790;809730;"Yeah, but I can't say anything specific."
193;810620;811790;"I need you to trust me."
194;812110;814040;"Do as Gotoh says."
195;816510;818600;"Yeah, got it."
196;818600;819790;"Put him back on."
197;821900;823800;"I'll ask about the conditions."
198;824220;825370;"Let me talk."
199;825680;828230;"Uh... Morel-san, was it?"
200;828230;832200;"This is my phone, and I'm talking to my buddy,"
201;832200;835120;"so why should I let you talk?"
202;835560;836890;"An excellent question."
203;838310;841050;"The answer is to give me the phone."
204;841710;844320;"No way. Get lost."
205;844700;845880;"Very well."
206;846680;848450;"Then, I have a favor to ask."
207;848870;853580;"My guess is that you'll say, "That isn't possible.""
208;854570;858080;"In which case, you should hand over the phone."
209;858750;860660;"Because I can make it possible."
210;863740;864960;"Hello?"
211;864960;866620;"No, it's nothing."
212;867090;868470;"Tell me the conditions."
213;869470;873470;"When we arrive,"
214;873970;878980;"there must be no one inside 
the building except Master Gon."
215;879320;880300;"Not even doctors?"
216;880610;881390;"Correct."
217;881840;882970;"Or any other patients?"
218;883280;883950;"Correct."
219;886910;889240;"That isn't possible!"
220;889570;891680;"This is a national hospital!"
221;891680;896230;"Do you have any idea how 
many people are in here?!"
222;901250;902170;"Hello?"
223;902610;904470;"I understand the conditions."
224;904470;905810;"Leave it to me."
225;906270;907560;"What is the plan?"
226;908590;910050;"This is a big hospital,"
227;910570;912090;"with a big parking lot."
228;913060;915440;"We'll set up a private room for Gon there."
229;916020;919640;"It'll be arranged so you can 
drive in and out of the area."
230;921060;923920;"I'll make sure that no one can learn"
231;923920;926110;"what you do inside."
232;926950;928390;"Understood."
233;928880;931040;"That satisfies our requirements."
234;931390;932530;"What is your name?"
235;933140;934510;"I'm Morel."
236;934820;938290;"From now on, I'd like you to 
be the one I speak with."
237;939700;940790;"There you go."
238;942620;944790;"Oh, I need to make another call."
239;947950;948870;"Knov?"
240;948870;949630;"It's me."
241;950030;952040;"The situation's changed."
242;952660;956470;"I need you to make sure the equipment 
is operable in an outside room."
243;957640;959860;"No, no monitors."
244;960160;961810;"And we can't have any windows."
245;962840;964100;"True..."
246;964620;967160;"It sounds like they have a <i>Nen</i> exorcist,"
247;967160;969610;"since they don't want anyone watching."
248;969610;971820;"But Killua made it sound like something else."
249;973460;975780;"The only <i>Nen </i>exorcist in the Hunter Association"
250;975780;977330;"said Gon was beyond help."
251;977820;980580;"But Killua said he could heal him with no risks."
252;982690;986260;"No, let's not pursue the matter."
253;987220;989340;"Killua said to let him take care of it."
254;990060;996100;"In the field, the rule is to listen when 
a trusted friend tells you to."
255;1000800;1005450;"Morel, I'll let you handle all contact with Killua."
256;1006110;1007670;"Yeah, I've got it."
257;1010590;1012330;"What are you going to do?"
258;1013730;1015610;"There are several people"
259;1016130;1018890;"I need to have a word with."
260;1033370;1035510;"Gon's fighting for his life..."
261;1036180;1038170;"Where are you, and what are you doing?"
262;1038170;1039560;"Why won't you answer your phone,"
263;1040460;1041890;"Kurapika?"
264;1057130;1062820;"And so, the Zodiacs respect the 
former chairman's wishes."
265;1062820;1065340;"And we've worked diligently to maintain"
266;1065340;1069670;"the status quo, and we seek 
to better the Association."
267;1069910;1076290;"Your vote, no matter for whom 
you vote, will not go to waste!"
268;1076290;1078680;"You can be assured of that."
269;1079060;1081220;"At the same time,"
270;1081220;1084130;"I'm sure that some people are dissatisfied"
271;1084130;1088190;"with the current state of the Association, 
or want to shake up the leadership."
272;1088830;1090800;"However, I must ask"
273;1090800;1095440;"that you do not express that opinion 
by refusing to cast a vote."
274;1096080;1100950;"You are more than welcome to make 
a speech up here, on the spot."
275;1100950;1104230;"All you have to do is speak up."
276;1104660;1109280;"We will never seek to smother a minority opinion."
277;1110170;1113150;"We have Ging here,"
278;1113150;1117340;"who commits countless violations every year,"
279;1117340;1121220;"but still calls himself a member of the Zodiacs."
280;1121750;1126230;"If you intend to skip the vote, 
you might as well vote for him."
281;1126580;1128730;"Ah, that was meant to be a joke."
282;1131510;1136240;"This was the final mission the 
former chairman gave us."
283;1136740;1141230;"The entire Association should 
work together to clear it!"
284;1143560;1147260;"Okay, thank you very much, Vice Chairman."
285;1147260;1149740;"Please return to your seat."
286;1150120;1151420;"Make it quick."
287;1152800;1155660;"We now open the floor to everyone here."
288;1156480;1162260;"If you'd like to express your views or 
ask a question, raise your hand."
289;1164050;1168020;"Okay, the big guy in the dark suit... Go ahead."
290;1179050;1181480;"I'm Leorio, from the 287th class."
291;1182180;1184970;"I have a question for that guy named Ging."
292;1186980;1189250;"That's Gon's dad."
293;1192300;1194760;"Why haven't you gone to visit Gon?"
294;1195220;1198550;"You must know his current condition!"
295;1204280;1207980;"Okay, let's hear the answer."
296;1208900;1212060;"First, what is your relationship to Gon?"
297;1212280;1213220;"We're buddies."
298;1213650;1216160;"Oh... I appreciate it."
299;1216830;1218660;"I hope you'll stay friends with him."
300;1219060;1219950;"That's all."
301;1220650;1222570;"Answer my question!"
302;1222890;1224320;"Or just go visit him!"
303;1224320;1226420;"Go visit Gon!"
304;1226790;1231580;"I've heard he has a number of friends like you."
305;1232020;1234180;"That should suffice."
306;1234580;1237090;"Don't give me that bull!"
307;1237090;1241840;"Do you have any idea how much 
Gon wants to see you?"
308;1242250;1247350;"If you talk to him, he might recover!"
309;1247720;1249850;"Did he say"
310;1250360;1253100;"that he wanted me to visit?"
311;1256670;1259260;"He couldn't say it if he wanted to..."
312;1265540;1267080;"You damned"
313;1267870;1270740;"bastard!"
314;1296090;1299110;"You can go to hell!"
315;1300620;1302460;"Wow!"
316;1302460;1308590;"You'll find footage of today's entire 
meeting on the Hunter site,"
317;1308590;1312570;"so tell everyone who wasn't present!"
318;1313600;1317180;"Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!"
319;1404720;1408470;"The Zoldyck family has different plans for Alluka."
320;1408660;1411840;"And this man never changes."
321;1411840;1415010;"Next time: Magician x And x Butler."
