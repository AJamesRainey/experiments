1;3640;8900;"To become kings, the Chimera Ants 
have spread across the world,"
2;9150;12280;"committing acts of utmost 
tyranny wherever they go."
3;18480;21040;"Fearing the damage will spread,"
4;21040;24370;"the government asks the Hunter 
Association to exterminate them."
5;24860;28250;"Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move."
6;91680;94190;"Ah, is that all?"
7;198960;203970;"Infiltration x And x Selection"
8;242620;244940;"Sneaking in was easy."
9;244940;248710;"But the question is how to get 
close enough to the enemy."
10;249300;253390;"And we can't let just anyone see us, either."
11;253480;259900;"{\fad(482,1)}Informants"
12;255540;258260;"This country has a powerful 
information regulation system that"
13;258260;259900;"operates in secret using groups of informants."
14;259900;261170;"Informants?"
15;261170;264910;"Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy, 
you receive a reward."
16;265200;267830;"If you find evidence of insurgency, 
you receive a reward."
17;267830;270170;"If you stop someone from fleeing the 
country, you receive a reward."
18;270560;273910;"So the people will do anything for that reward."
19;274500;276090;"And they aren't just after money."
20;276590;280710;"After racking up enough informant points, 
the entire group is promoted."
21;281140;285650;"But if someone provides false information 
or a member commits a crime,"
22;285650;288140;"the entire group is punished."
23;288960;290480;"Carrot and stick, huh?"
24;291100;292920;"It's pretty nasty business."
25;293700;296440;"Family members are put in different groups."
26;296940;299440;"So if an entire group tries to escape,"
27;299440;303140;"the other family members can be 
executed or imprisoned for life."
28;304270;309830;"If a family is caught trying to escape together, 
they'll be executed, no questions asked."
29;310770;314170;"For this country's elite to live the good life,"
30;314170;316330;"the rest of its citizens must scrape by."
31;316560;321530;"But the media also spreads lies. 
Such as that, in other countries,"
32;321530;324600;"half the population starves by age ten."
33;324600;327550;"Foreign aid never reaches the needy."
34;327550;330600;"Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles."
35;331440;335220;"It's even said that East Gorteau spends 
grant money developing nuclear weapons"
36;335220;340050;"that become bargaining chips in negotiations 
for unprecedented foreign aid increases."
37;341970;344360;"Hey, don't overheat!"
38;344580;347250;"I th-think I'm okay..."
39;347250;349510;"That was just so complicated..."
40;351340;353980;"But you sure know a lot about it."
41;353980;355510;"My brother told me everything."
42;355910;358370;"And he probably heard it from Grandpa."
43;358580;359720;"Your grandpa?"
44;359720;364760;"Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated 
the country for a job."
45;365600;369240;"And I've seen similar information 
on Hunter websites."
46;369240;372170;"The system is likely still in use."
47;385550;386500;"There's a village."
48;386500;388470;"Yeah... It's not very big."
49;388470;389300;"What do we do?"
50;389760;390580;"Sneak in."
51;391010;392990;"Is that a good idea?"
52;393570;395410;"We need current information."
53;395830;400920;"Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or 
how to identify someone's rank will help."
54;401470;405920;"They may have certain practices to root out spies."
55;406890;409130;"The more data we have, the better."
56;410020;411160;"Wait here."
57;447030;448860;"It's completely deserted..."
58;448860;451970;"Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?"
59;452440;454470;"No, something happened here."
60;456560;457970;"And someone's trying to hide it."
61;457970;458880;"Huh?"
62;461750;463730;"They did a sloppy job."
63;483070;486510;"They didn't dig deep enough, 
so wild dogs got to the bodies."
64;486960;489760;"I'd imagine the entire village is buried here."
65;490110;491630;"What's going on?"
66;492320;494890;"This is the true purpose of 
the national celebration."
67;495390;500770;"It's a pretense for entire populations of towns 
and cities to vanish without raising suspicion."
68;502350;504330;"The selection has already begun."
69;506570;507770;"In hindsight,"
70;508090;512500;"it would be tough to summon all citizens to 
the capital and make the selection so quickly."
71;512920;515760;"This nation has a population 
of around five million."
72;516300;519970;"Clearing out one town or city 
at a time is more effective."
73;520590;524930;"In that case, their only concern would 
be coworkers or family members"
74;524930;527330;"raising a fuss over the missing."
75;528770;531480;"But with the pretext of the national celebration,"
76;531480;535270;"no one will find it strange that 
they can't contact someone."
77;537550;539750;"In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed,"
78;539750;544920;"so if they believe the other party is traveling, 
it makes sense that they can't contact them."
79;545680;548020;"The selection will go very smoothly."
80;549890;553090;"The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner."
81;553620;556820;"They only need to attack the farthest
towns first and work their way east."
82;557660;563580;"If each town is told that the government 
will assign its people a time to depart,"
83;563870;568030;"there won't be any problems regarding 
communication between towns."
84;568470;573210;"So, by preventing people from meeting 
between towns to travel together,"
85;573210;575490;"they eliminate any cause for commotion."
86;576490;577470;"But..."
87;577470;578240;"Hmm?"
88;578240;579500;"That means"
89;579500;583370;"they have to run around the nation 
to attack all five million citizens."
90;583370;584100;"Yeah."
91;584730;589610;"If one percent survives, that gives 
them fifty thousand soldiers."
92;589940;592580;"No, I mean before that."
93;593100;596870;"There are ten... No, nine days left."
94;596870;600100;"If you wanted to check five 
million people in that time,"
95;600100;603120;"you'd need a lot of help."
96;603450;605960;"Assuming that one <i>Nen</i> user"
97;605960;609510;"can check ten thousand citizens in ten days..."
98;613520;614630;"Five hundred <i>Nen</i> users."
99;614880;616130;"Exactly!"
100;616670;620980;"You're getting at the fact that there can't 
be that many Ants who can use <i>Nen</i>?"
101;620980;621760;"Yeah."
102;622340;625300;"I agree, but it probably isn't that hard."
103;625860;629100;"They don't need <i>Nen</i> users to check everyone."
104;629100;630770;"Huh? Why not?"
105;631620;632770;"They can use manipulation."
106;647770;650040;"The power that Chimera Ant used..."
107;650890;652990;"I'm guessing it can be used 
to automate victims or,"
108;652990;656750;"like Genthru's power, can probably be 
used to control multiple people at once."
109;659030;661520;"Ordinary humans have aura as well,"
110;661520;665800;"so the manipulator could force a 
victim's aura to concentrate in his fist."
111;665800;670710;"One punch alone could create 
an army of fifty thousand."
112;671280;674370;"While leaving four million, nine hundred 
and fifty thousand dead in the process."
113;680630;683420;"Well, it isn't all bad news."
114;683830;685330;"If my theory is correct,"
115;685800;690330;"causing a commotion to stop their 
selection will be simple."
116;691450;693480;"We merely have to pop up,"
117;693480;697100;"take out whoever is being controlled, 
and cause a panic."
118;699280;701160;"Then we just encourage"
119;701160;704550;"the people who escape to 
check on other towns nearby."
120;705310;709350;"If the Chimera Ants have sent controlled 
puppets, rather than actual <i>Nen</i> users,"
121;709350;711290;"taking them down will be a cinch."
122;711290;714390;"We'll just run around, taking them down 
one after another, and wreak havoc."
123;714950;715740;"Yeah."
124;716480;719220;"The problem is that they'll detect us quickly."
125;721400;723380;"Once we make our move, 
they'll know we're here."
126;724540;729230;"If we want to go with the old man's 
plan, we should stay hidden."
127;734510;735500;"What do you think?"
128;743960;745390;"Let's do it."
129;745760;748250;"If the selection has already begun,"
130;748250;750640;"we can't just stand around watching."
131;753670;755650;"Okay, let's do it."
132;755650;756660;"Uh-huh!"
133;756660;758670;"But I'll do this alone."
134;758670;759510;"Huh?"
135;759510;760950;"You stay in hiding."
136;760950;761930;"Why?"
137;761930;763280;"It'll go better if we both—"
138;763410;765530;"Don't forget our main mission!"
139;766620;768280;"Defeating that Chimera Ant."
140;769640;771220;"That should be your focus."
141;773780;775920;"Let me handle everything else."
142;775920;777470;"I'll stir things up."
143;778480;782960;"And no offense, but I work more easily alone."
144;782960;784800;"Jeez... Fine, I got it."
145;786690;787640;"Really?"
146;788290;789030;"Huh?"
147;791370;793060;"Do you really understand?"
148;793860;794790;"Killua?"
149;797510;799940;"Promise me you won't make a move!"
150;800420;803220;"Not even if people are killed 
right before your eyes!"
151;804770;805950;"Promise!"
152;823530;825220;"I'll contact you by text."
153;825830;828470;"Our cell phones should still work in this area."
154;829240;830350;"Killua?"
155;831400;834360;"Sorry... It's nothing!"
156;834360;836190;"I'm just a little tense."
157;845340;846860;"What's this?"
158;847680;850870;"They aren't citizens of this country."
159;851670;854520;"I would expect a couple of kids to be spies."
160;854520;857280;"But they're definitely strong..."
161;857280;858870;"Are they assassins?"
162;860290;862880;"Are they here to hunt down the King?"
163;863760;866730;"Then I can't ignore them..."
164;866730;869890;"But I don't want to fight them both at once."
165;869890;873430;"I definitely don't want to fight the 
silver-haired one on the left."
166;873860;876350;"Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong."
167;876350;879030;"As much potential as a Squadron Leader?"
168;883780;885900;"That kid is something special."
169;886840;890780;"I completely concealed my presence, 
but he still sensed something?"
170;904790;906810;"How convenient!"
171;919970;922560;"Are you sure about this?"
172;923190;927570;"You'll really transport my family 
and me to another country?"
173;928020;929960;"Do not worry."
174;929960;935330;"We have received official approval, 
and prepared the necessary documents."
175;935640;939330;"All that's left is for you to sign the papers."
176;939900;944820;"However, the condition that you share 
your complete knowledge of military affairs"
177;944820;946980;"in exchange for your freedom is essential."
178;946980;949350;"As mentioned in the agreement,"
179;949350;952590;"if you do not keep up your end after signing,"
180;953060;956600;"we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions."
181;956600;958630;"That won't be a problem."
182;959260;960750;"I'll tell you everything..."
183;963980;969880;"All I know about the atrocities 
that Diego has committed."
184;970700;972230;"We appreciate it."
185;972230;975370;"Our lives are on the line, as well."
186;977320;978810;""That Diego has committed"?"
187;979220;981370;"You talk like it doesn't concern you."
188;981940;985140;"The wine you're drinking and 
the room you stand in"
189;985640;988450;"were earned by following that bastard."
190;990290;993310;"You mean "that we've committed," 
you son of a bitch."
191;997630;1000590;"But I get it... We're here on business."
192;1001770;1003390;"So, Marcos-san..."
193;1004180;1006980;"Continue going about your business as normal."
194;1008040;1012390;"In two weeks, you and your family 
will be relaxing on the beach."
195;1014810;1016530;"I can't accept it!"
196;1020450;1024870;"We're supposed to stand around, 
watching as people are killed?"
197;1024870;1026190;"Are you sleepy?"
198;1026190;1028220;"Want me to put you to sleep, eh?"
199;1028770;1031050;"Calm yourself."
200;1031780;1034990;"If they're gonna check five 
million citizens in ten days,"
201;1034990;1037300;"simple arithmetic says that's 
five hundred thousand per day!"
202;1037300;1040140;"Of which one percent will survive!"
203;1040140;1041060;"And your point is?"
204;1041490;1045580;"That means four hundred, ninety-five 
thousand have already been killed!"
205;1045580;1047690;"How can you be so calm?"
206;1047690;1052570;"Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!"
207;1056230;1059210;"If the plan fails, everyone dies."
208;1059210;1062210;"If we can't draw the three Royal 
Guards away from the King,"
209;1062210;1064830;"not even the Chairman will 
be able to defeat the King."
210;1065400;1071340;"Thus, we cannot let them discover 
our existence before the time is right."
211;1071770;1076490;"If that happens, security around the 
King will be even further tightened."
212;1078040;1079350;"You must endure this."
213;1082320;1086100;"You're telling me to sacrifice five 
million to save the human race?"
214;1086610;1087850;"That's right."
215;1089880;1092780;"If blaming me consoles you, go ahead."
216;1093520;1098570;"But if you don't have a better idea, 
don't be too self-righteous."
217;1100690;1101990;"Damn it..."
218;1103980;1106500;"We must do only what we can."
219;1106770;1111500;"But we must put our lives on the line to do so."
220;1114200;1115190;"Yeah..."
221;1128130;1129810;"Is Killua okay?"
222;1130350;1132100;"He was acting a little weird."
223;1132860;1135880;"Maybe I should have stuck with him?"
224;1136360;1139820;"But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad."
225;1164980;1166600;"You did well to avoid that."
226;1166950;1168660;"How about this?"
227;1189180;1193850;"I use my strong tail as a spring, 
to propel me among the trees!"
228;1194420;1197550;"In the darkness, following my 
movement is impossible!"
229;1202890;1204760;"Caught you!"
230;1205220;1208670;"Now I'm going to crush you!"
231;1212970;1214670;"You're not crushing me!"
232;1215360;1215860;"Huh?"
233;1217690;1221330;"I'm the one who caught <i>you</i>!"
234;1230110;1232670;"He seems to have a snake's genes,"
235;1232670;1237120;"so he should be able to go ten 
days without starving to death."
236;1240210;1243090;"As I thought... He's strong..."
237;1243900;1247050;"But I should continue to observe."
238;1250080;1252080;"I already let them find me..."
239;1252570;1254140;"I need to hide better."
240;1255600;1257240;"But it's strange..."
241;1257240;1260990;"Why are there soldiers around if the 
selection is already finished here?"
242;1261890;1265540;"Maybe there are extra guards 
because we're near the border."
243;1281170;1283150;"An owl and a bat?"
244;1297300;1299580;"This time, he's facing two..."
245;1301370;1302940;"What will he do?"
246;1308490;1312450;"The Chimera Ants are using 
darkness to attack Gon."
247;1313580;1317860;"And why is Meleoron following him?"
248;1404630;1407340;"Next time: Combination x And x Evolution."
249;1407340;1408860;"Come on down, everyone..."
250;1408860;1410840;"I have a perfectly ordinary box, 
which has not been touched."
251;1410840;1412090;"One, two, three!"
252;1412090;1414220;"That would be an illusion."
