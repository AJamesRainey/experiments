1;1680;2980;"Kite is alive!"
2;4410;8410;"He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!"
3;9380;11150;"So we should hurry back..."
4;11740;12870;"Once we're stronger."
5;15550;17070;"To save Kite!"
6;97990;102990;"Promise x and x Reunion"
7;104770;107460;"Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite."
8;108250;110790;"But before they can return to NGL,"
9;110790;114110;"they must pass the condition 
set by Chairman Netero,"
10;114110;117470;"leader of the punitive force."
11;119530;120970;"What are those?"
12;121750;122750;"Tokens."
13;123250;125900;"You take a piece of marked wood and split it,"
14;125900;127980;"giving each half to a different person."
15;128950;130780;"They work as proof that you're an ally"
16;130780;132480;"or to authenticate a document."
17;134090;137990;"We sent two assassins to the nearest village."
18;141440;142990;"In this case,"
19;142990;145800;"each of the two assassins 
holds one matching token."
20;147900;149710;"We defeat them and take the tokens."
21;162570;164010;"It's been erased."
22;164700;166660;"That means someone checked the board."
23;167230;168020;"Yeah."
24;173520;177040;"You must be Killua and Gon."
25;178610;180400;"Nice to meet you."
26;181410;184780;"My name is Palm."
27;186220;188040;"It's a pleasure."
28;189770;192020;"Oh, dear..."
29;192020;194470;"No need to be so tense."
30;194470;198010;"I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details."
31;198540;200440;"Allow me to explain."
32;200440;202290;"Why don't we have some tea?"
33;206650;210060;"I am a student of Knov-sensei."
34;210610;214420;"He said I would only get in his way..."
35;214420;216270;"But I insisted on accompanying him."
36;217130;218330;"Who's that?"
37;218330;221250;"She probably means one of the 
guys with Chairman Netero."
38;221250;223820;"Yes, the one wearing a black suit..."
39;224390;227050;"My teacher is an incredible person."
40;227050;230120;"Cool, intelligent, composed..."
41;230120;233090;"Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!"
42;233090;234120;"Oh, dear..."
43;234120;236790;"Oh, but I only respect him, that's all."
44;236790;239210;"There's nothing romantic about my feelings..."
45;240250;243600;"At least, I may wish that were the case."
46;245760;251240;"After all, when it comes to falling 
in love, respect is a major factor."
47;251610;255590;"Ah, my teacher knows nothing 
about this, of course."
48;255590;258240;"I haven't said a word to him, 
and I don't intend to."
49;266040;269540;"No one can say what will happen..."
50;270100;273750;"After all, love is a spontaneous thing,"
51;273750;274980;"don't you agree?"
52;274980;277080;"Uh, can I interrupt you?"
53;277080;278660;"Aren't we supposed to fight you?"
54;279050;281010;"Huh? Oh, dear..."
55;281010;283050;"Yes, I apologize."
56;283510;285330;"The Chairman and my teacher"
57;285330;289360;"said I couldn't accompany them any farther."
58;290570;293010;"But I insisted on going with them."
59;293010;299230;"It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying 
to convince them of my determination."
60;299230;301890;"And finally, they relented, with one condition."
61;302840;304190;"Uh, I'm asking about..."
62;304190;307730;"My teacher may appear a cold person,"
63;307730;309490;"but he's actually quite gentle."
64;309490;313630;"But you have to spend a lot of 
time with him to realize that."
65;313630;316450;"Ah, by "spending time with him," I don't mean—"
66;316450;318630;"Okay! What's the condition?!"
67;320790;324210;"Knuckle and Shoot's defeat."
68;325160;332270;"To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats"
69;332270;335520;"will be allowed inside NGL before me..."
70;335520;337640;"I cannot allow that."
71;337640;340360;"Palm-san, turn off your <i>Hatsu</i>!"
72;341930;345040;"She's an Enhancer like me."
73;345040;346670;"I'm not too happy about that."
74;346670;348460;"Knuckle and Shoot?"
75;348460;349720;"Not us?"
76;349720;350830;"That's right."
77;351920;357080;"After all, I'm not the one who's 
supposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot."
78;357080;359000;"You two are."
79;360720;364000;"Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students."
80;366180;369330;"They, too, received a condition."
81;369330;372510;"I don't know what that condition was..."
82;372510;378520;"But whether it's us or them, only one 
group will be allowed into NGL."
83;379020;382020;"The deadline is one month."
84;382640;387720;"Since we were told to keep 
these tokens for a month,"
85;387720;391710;"that means someone will come for them."
86;397990;400290;"What do we do, Knuckle?"
87;400930;402290;"That's easy."
88;402840;404170;"He who strikes first, wins!"
89;404910;406760;"Find 'em..."
90;407120;408610;"And kill 'em!"
91;407990;409430;"Certain Death"
92;410330;412930;"My name is Knuckle Bine!"
93;413200;415310;"I am a Beast Hunter!"
94;415660;420080;"I challenge the two punitive 
force candidates to a duel!"
95;420550;425080;"Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!"
96;424190;432950;"Bring it on"
97;425410;427750;"I won't try to run or hide."
98;427750;430220;"I won't bring any weapons or allies."
99;430220;432300;"It'll just be me and me alone."
100;432950;435990;"So come and fight me!"
101;435990;436830;"But where?"
102;437160;438580;"The location?"
103;438870;441580;"You have to tell them where to find you."
104;441580;453840;"Bring it on"
105;441820;446430;"A man never turns his back on an enemy."
106;446430;449090;"I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth..."
107;449550;452460;"You won't get away!"
108;451340;453840;"Even if he said where, I wouldn't go."
109;454880;456390;"He's just a decoy."
110;456390;458720;"His partner's probably hidden 
somewhere, watching."
111;459150;464240;"They're watching to see if 
anyone reacts suspiciously."
112;464830;469170;"According to Palm, they don't 
even know our names."
113;469170;470110;"Yeah."
114;470880;473150;"So their goal must be to smoke us out."
115;473740;476020;"No one's stupid enough to do all that for real."
116;476820;478740;"Did he look strong?"
117;479620;480750;"He's pretty strong."
118;483420;485400;"What will it take to defeat him?"
119;486410;488250;"I have no idea!"
120;488900;490990;"One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that"
121;491390;493670;"In a <i>Nen</i> battle, nothing is certain."
122;494490;497320;"So, according to him,"
123;497320;500620;"it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won."
124;500620;501960;"I disagree."
125;503180;506420;"If you want to survive, you must 
increase your odds of victory."
126;507010;510780;"Gauging the strength differential between 
you and an opponent is crucial."
127;513640;516070;"If you're up against someone you can only beat"
128;516070;518820;"once or twice out of a 
hundred times, don't bother."
129;521790;523660;"You need at least a fifty-percent chance."
130;525310;527800;"If possible, greater than 
seventy percent is preferable."
131;528670;531920;"To reach that, we must do two things..."
132;532740;536890;"Work on our fundamentals, and learn 
more about our opponents' abilities."
133;536890;537800;"Right."
134;538570;541930;"If we know our opponents' abilities, 
it'll be easier to plan ahead."
135;541930;543420;"Like we did against Genthru."
136;546010;548440;"I'm half agreed, and half opposed."
137;549390;550690;"What do you mean?"
138;550690;553700;"I think we should work on our fundamentals,"
139;553700;556950;"but I don't think we need to know their abilities."
140;557340;559400;"Huh? Why not?"
141;559400;561820;"That just increases our risk of defeat."
142;561820;563450;"Nothing good can come of that!"
143;563780;567960;"But that's what we'll be facing in NGL."
144;569100;572730;"Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot..."
145;573120;577260;"It's to become stronger, 
and return to NGL and save Kite."
146;580770;581730;"In other words,"
147;581730;586270;"we must be strong enough to defeat 
enemies we know nothing about."
148;586870;589920;"Winning here with advance 
preparation is pointless."
149;590590;592150;"That's true,"
150;592410;594860;"{\fad(1,182)}but we have to defeat these opponents first."
151;596290;600010;"After all, we only have a month."
152;600680;602160;"That's too long."
153;603020;604450;"One week."
154;604450;607290;"In one week, we'll be stronger, 
and heading back to NGL!"
155;607820;608490;"Go—"
156;609190;610750;"Are you an idiot?!"
157;614760;616040;"Bisky!"
158;617200;618910;"Why are you here?"
159;618910;621010;"I asked her to come."
160;621010;623420;"Huh? You know each other?"
161;623420;627290;"No, I looked into your backgrounds."
162;627290;628490;"How?"
163;628490;629900;"We only know Bisky because..."
164;631430;635000;"Once I used my power, it was quite simple."
165;635000;637430;"Now, there's no time to spare."
166;637430;638400;"Let's begin..."
167;639940;643300;"The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples."
168;643300;644740;"Um, no."
169;648900;650600;"Let's get started, then."
170;650600;651420;"Osu!"
171;653380;655490;"What was that for?!"
172;655490;656940;"I'm picking up where I left off."
173;656940;658300;"Are you stupid?"
174;658810;662430;"That old man's famous for his nasty nature."
175;665340;667900;"If he tells you to do something in a month,"
176;667900;671670;"it probably should take an entire year."
177;671670;674190;"You won't defeat them after a week!"
178;674570;679180;"But we have to hurry back and save Kite."
179;679180;681070;"What are you talking about?"
180;689770;691790;"That was fun..."
181;692420;694720;"Like a dream come true."
182;700370;702510;"I'd love to fight you..."
183;704560;705950;"once more."
184;708230;709570;"I see..."
185;710470;714180;"All the more reason you shouldn't 
return without proper training!"
186;715100;718060;"What if you make the same mistake again?!"
187;718060;719940;"So typical of her age."
188;719940;721990;"She's always ready with a lecture."
189;722530;723990;"Got it?"
190;724490;725540;"Osu..."
191;725540;727640;"Let's start training, then."
192;730740;733210;"Begin with <i>Ren</i>!"
193;736780;739630;"Maintain that for three hours."
194;741630;744120;"Killua, how long can you last?"
195;744120;747890;"In top condition, I can manage 
around fifty-five minutes, max."
196;748180;750770;"Until you complete this, 
we can't move to the next step."
197;751230;753190;"Train like your lives are on the line!"
198;770670;771820;"Come on."
199;771820;774120;"You didn't even last an hour."
200;774120;775290;"Okay, keep working."
201;781610;786060;"They say it takes a month to add ten 
minutes to your <i>Ren</i> endurance."
202;786470;789050;"You won't have time to sleep."
203;795480;797810;"Curses..."
204;798100;801050;"Those damn cowards ran away!"
205;801050;803440;"You bastards deserve to die now!"
206;811470;813470;"You have a collar."
207;813470;815440;"Where's your owner?"
208;815930;819590;"You're supposed to keep the park clean."
209;820940;822840;"Okay, you can rest for today!"
210;823190;825460;"Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes."
211;831630;835540;"Looks like it's time for me to use my power."
212;853050;855500;"Take it away, Cookie-chan."
213;860750;864650;"Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage."
214;863920;865760;"Pink Relief"
215;870690;871620;"Excuse me..."
216;872630;875470;"I hope this won't offend you,"
217;875470;878180;"but I'll let you decide how to train them."
218;878180;882020;"Since my power told me that 
you would be the answer."
219;882640;884050;"However,"
220;884050;890400;"if they cannot defeat Morel's 
disciples after one month,"
221;890400;895000;"I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself."
222;895000;898610;"I absolutely must go to NGL."
223;898610;900840;"Honestly, I want to depart this moment."
224;900840;905040;"So after I've waited and waited 
and waited and waited and waited,"
225;905040;906550;"if this fails now,"
226;907190;910800;"I'll probably kill all of you..."
227;910800;912310;"Was that a threat?"
228;912780;914780;"No, it's a warning."
229;914780;917220;"I'm worried about you all."
230;917220;922310;"So if you think they have no chance, 
I recommend that you leave..."
231;922650;927730;"Speaking from experience, I'm less 
likely to lose my temper that way."
232;928240;931350;"I'm not the one you should tell."
233;931350;933820;"Once they're awake, tell the boys."
234;938110;940340;"Don't worry! We've got this!"
235;940340;943580;"You can count on us to get you to NGL."
236;943900;947750;"So let us know if you notice anything."
237;947750;949120;"We'll do our best."
238;953240;954670;"That's how they are."
239;954670;956100;"Have some faith."
240;963630;964400;"Oh, dear!"
241;964400;966490;"This won't do at all..."
242;967510;972430;"Anyway, I'm more concerned about 
what's happening inside NGL."
243;972860;976140;"What is the Chairman's group 
doing for the next month?"
244;976140;976740;"Well?!"
245;977840;979250;"Ah, well..."
246;979250;982450;"They mentioned they'd be poking and probing."
247;982450;986250;"Identifying the enemy's strengths, 
and weakening their forces..."
248;987220;990200;"The experts can't agree on the amount of time"
249;990200;993870;"remaining before the King's birth."
250;993870;997270;"The Chairman is operating with two months,"
251;997270;999290;"the earliest prediction, as the deadline."
252;1001560;1003230;"This is bad."
253;1007550;1010530;"That thing is stronger than I am."
254;1011250;1013800;"Stronger than the Chairman?"
255;1013800;1015410;"Surely you jest."
256;1015760;1017420;"If that's really true,"
257;1017420;1021640;"none of the Hunters will be able to fight it."
258;1022530;1028270;"It's been more than half a century since 
I was the strongest among <i>Nen</i> users."
259;1028860;1033050;"Now, I'm more or less even with you guys."
260;1033400;1036010;"Then you're more than strong enough."
261;1036620;1038620;"You should have more confidence."
262;1038620;1042010;"Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?"
263;1042010;1044170;"Growing old is no fun."
264;1045100;1047180;"He never stops talking."
265;1047180;1048810;"But we must fight."
266;1049440;1052470;"I would prefer to avoid it..."
267;1052970;1056310;"If there were a solution that would 
avoid a fight, I'd choose it."
268;1057490;1061260;"Our target is the Queen, 
and the Queen alone."
269;1062010;1065960;"But sneaking past the surveillance of 
that <i>En</i> will be next to impossible."
270;1065960;1068530;"We cannot avoid a fight..."
271;1069830;1072980;"The question is how we will manage to win."
272;1073590;1076590;"If anyone has any brilliant ideas, 
I'd like to hear them."
273;1077520;1079540;"You're simply awful."
274;1080070;1083670;"When you asked us to join, did you not 
already have an answer in mind?"
275;1087100;1090450;"We exterminate the Ants 
in silence, one at a time."
276;1115670;1118050;"Yeah, let's take it slow."
277;1118550;1121260;"{\fad(1,556)}Might as well enjoy the job..."
278;1121980;1123270;"Okay..."
279;1123760;1127070;"First, we should learn the enemy's numbers."
280;1127700;1128440;"Go."
281;1138790;1140300;"So many."
282;1140810;1142290;"Something is coming."
283;1142780;1144580;"They aren't alive..."
284;1145270;1147070;"Is this the enemy's power?"
285;1147650;1150210;"Now, what to do?"
286;1151440;1153420;"You may as well wait."
287;1155910;1159720;"If they come here, we simply destroy them."
288;1160290;1162450;"You have a point."
289;1162450;1164430;"These could be decoys."
290;1164430;1165760;"Huh, what?"
291;1165760;1167730;"Was I speaking aloud?"
292;1168130;1169150;"No."
293;1169690;1172480;"I simply knew what you were thinking."
294;1173070;1174980;"Who are you, anyway?"
295;1178250;1181000;"One of the Queen's Royal Guard."
296;1182110;1183460;"Shaiapouf."
297;1187540;1191500;"Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken."
298;1194580;1197780;"Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf."
299;1198700;1201380;"Yes, that is correct."
300;1202180;1204410;"You can read all my thoughts."
301;1204410;1205720;"Not sure I like that."
302;1205720;1208720;"Well, I can understand the sentiment."
303;1211390;1212330;"But..."
304;1213590;1215050;"He will wake soon."
305;1215050;1216650;"That's good news!"
306;1218010;1224020;"{\fad(1,630)}You see, I haven't been able to 
decide what power to develop."
307;1231860;1234720;"Right, it's so simple."
308;1235660;1237700;"I merely need to fix him."
309;1237700;1239710;"I only need the power to do that."
310;1244650;1249930;"And then, I will be able to experience 
that dreamlike moment with you"
311;1250790;1252390;"once more..."
312;1265950;1267950;"Come on, what are you doing?"
313;1268570;1273120;"You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot, 
much less the Chimera Ants, like this."
314;1273510;1276160;"Are you giving up on going to NGL?"
315;1278460;1280130;"N-No way..."
316;1281050;1282660;"We never give up."
317;1284220;1289110;"We must return to NGL, no matter 
what we have to do to get there!"
318;1296580;1298890;"To save Kite..."
319;1304860;1306970;"After reuniting with Bisky,"
320;1306970;1309380;"Gon and Killua are back to training."
321;1309380;1311500;"They have one goal:"
322;1311500;1314500;"to get strong enough to save Kite."
323;1314870;1318780;"Right now, that motivation is driving Gon."
324;1405150;1408050;"Next time: Duel x and x Escape."
325;1408050;1409170;"It's on, Killua!"
326;1409170;1410490;"It's on, Gon!"
327;1412020;1413800;"Rock, paper... Rock!"
328;1414150;1415680;"I lost..."
