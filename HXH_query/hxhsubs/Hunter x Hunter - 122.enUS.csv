3;10800;13760;"He acknowledged our efforts."
4;14540;16390;"He wasn't a bad guy."
5;18610;22100;"In that case, I no longer have..."

7;25660;27000;"The King..."
8;27470;30000;"The soldiers are not important."

will become demons if necessary."

11;189800;193730;"This is an area used for testing weapons of war."
12;195670;198550;"We won't need to restrain ourselves."
13;207950;209480;"Why do you fight?"
14;212310;214490;"You have no chance of defeating me."
15;215910;218220;"Why rush to your death?"
16;224390;227350;"You presume to know I cannot win?"
17;227720;230120;"You know nothing about me."
18;233440;235800;"If you judge me by my appearance,"
19;236810;239200;"you'll get burned."
20;240130;241260;"You have it backwards."
21;243010;247470;"You don't seem like some ordinary man 
who can't read the state of the battle."
22;249160;252940;"I was born to rule this world."
23;253380;258400;"Originally, you humans were as 
no more than livestock to me."
24;259860;261530;"But I have changed my mind."
25;264670;269720;"I learned that there are a few 
humans worth keeping alive."
26;271180;273000;"Like that woman."
27;277690;281000;"I sense that you are worthy, as well."
28;283260;285590;"If you back down now,"
29;286810;289030;"I am willing to spare your life."
30;295030;298890;"You'll only spare my life, yes?"
31;303680;305880;"Given my position,"
32;306440;308990;"I can't accept that offer."
33;319110;321000;"Meanwhile..."
34;321880;324640;"In exchange for his agreement to stay still,"
35;324640;329360;"Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain 
just what had happened."
36;346080;350430;"Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling 
him what happened after the attack."
37;350430;353990;"In other words, everything since 
they'd been separated."
38;356530;360160;"Pitou made it a point to include 
details that Gon did not know,"
39;360610;365240;"to ensure that Gon's attention would 
be focused on the explanation."
40;367450;371930;"Pitou deliberately did not mention 
how the King had held Komugi"
41;372630;377890;"because Pitou did not know how to 
describe the events accurately."
42;386340;389240;"There was no significant change in Gon."
43;391710;392660;"However..."
44;394150;399470;"Pitou knew the plan had succeeded 
when Gon's eyes wavered briefly."
45;404580;405620;"The King..."
46;407750;412050;"left with the enemy of his own 
volition, by that doorway."
47;412960;415280;"There is no need for us to go."
48;421030;422310;"I see."
49;423030;424320;"He went south."
50;425410;426570;"I understand."
51;427620;429620;"A fine play, Pitou."
52;431720;437530;"Then we should await the King's return here."
53;443510;448830;"To maintain only my outward appearance, 
I only need one-seventh of my flies."
54;452900;455430;"The other six-sevenths"
55;457330;458720;"will go to the King!"
56;474350;476970;"You fight with the resolve to lose?"
57;479170;480750;"I do not understand."
58;482580;485000;"You fight for the human race?"
59;485520;489880;"If so, then know that my actions 
are, in fact, for their benefit."
60;493360;496310;"For example, in human society,"
61;496310;499700;"lands are divided by national borders, 
much like territorial marking."
62;501340;504380;"On the right side of the border, 
children may starve to death."
63;505600;510050;"While on the left, scum who do nothing
have everything they need."
64;511510;513120;"Absolute madness."
65;516070;517910;"I shall crush that madness..."
66;519010;521370;"And create a world so fair,"
67;521370;526300;"the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!"
68;542410;544180;"I concede that"
69;544180;547950;"I will initially use power and terror 
to accomplish my objective."
70;548320;552820;"But I will only do so to the extent 
necessary to maintain order."
71;553700;558070;"I have learned what power 
is meant to be used for."
72;561600;565440;"To protect the weak,"
73;566230;568040;"who deserve to live."
74;569420;572550;"Power is not meant to be used 
to torment the defeated!"
75;580450;583190;"This could be a problem..."
76;584830;586750;"I shall not fight you."
77;587920;590710;"I agreed to leave the palace"
78;592870;595790;"so we could have a free, open discussion."
79;597350;600160;"He's wavering..."
80;602610;603700;"Come closer."
81;605180;607870;"Wavering between Ant and human."
82;608880;611220;"And he hasn't realized"
83;612370;615940;"that those two sides are incompatible."
84;618100;619820;"And neither one"
85;620940;622510;"is dominant yet."
86;625070;629140;"But regardless of which side he falls to,"
87;629780;632010;"the outcome won't change."
88;637310;638490;"We're counting on you."
89;638930;641650;"You have a single mission."
90;642000;645370;"The immediate extermination 
of these dangerous creatures."
91;646960;650170;"There have already been many casualties."
92;650880;653330;"We will use any means necessary."
93;653330;655880;"Will that be acceptable?"
94;656630;660880;"Naturally, we have no intention of 
telling the experts how to proceed."
95;663960;665570;"We simply desire"
96;665570;670230;"those dangerous creatures 
eradicated as swiftly as possible."
97;671400;673110;"Understood."
98;675110;680860;"So their goal is to eradicate the Ants, 
leaving the Hunters Association"
99;681520;683300;"to take the blame."
100;686280;689370;"I must make this fast..."
101;691070;693330;"Before my heart is swayed."
102;699600;700970;"King..."
103;702030;704280;"We are both in difficult positions."
104;771200;775960;"{\fad(1572,1)}100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva"

108;812260;813260;"That's..."
109;818830;821950;"I can't sense anyone else fighting."
110;822310;824410;"Does that mean I'm the only one left?"
111;826430;827440;"Youpi!"
112;830410;831440;"Pouf!"
113;831890;834480;"You've changed a lot since I last saw you."
114;835260;837800;"I could say the same to you."
115;839980;843890;"I had to escape without alerting the enemy."
116;845250;848940;"And if I move all my dispersed particles 
at once, it's too conspicuous."
117;848940;850040;"So I must go slowly."
118;851790;855290;"I'm sure you're feeling impatient, 
but please spare me a moment."
119;856230;858270;"I need to tell you what's happening."
120;861460;866920;"Well, I suppose you have your own concerns..."
121;871150;873190;"You've grown up."
122;879600;881780;"And there you have it."
123;883510;885880;"I have no conclusive proof"
124;887900;892690;"that the change in Pitou will 
actually benefit the King..."
125;903750;908780;"Through his own experiences, 
Youpi could understand Pitou's behavior."
126;909420;910400;"Youpi..."
127;912210;915920;"What do you think we should do?"
128;923600;925110;"This was a test."
129;926160;928330;"Which made it very clear to Youpi"
130;928800;935120;"that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes"
131;935120;937290;"Pitou and Youpi had undergone."
132;942050;943500;"A foolish question."
133;958500;960510;"We must go"
134;961570;963310;"to the King at once!"
135;965780;969470;"And that's all there is to it... Right?"
136;970320;972530;"His response was entirely sincere."
137;975460;976480;"Indeed."
138;977200;982780;"He was concerned only with 
leaving as soon as possible."
139;985520;990280;"Because Youpi was feeling the same fear."
140;1029950;1031720;"I'm sure that was a direct hit..."
141;1033130;1034210;"He's tough!"
142;1038830;1040110;"A good attack."
143;1041600;1043310;"I could not anticipate it."
144;1047930;1049390;"Are you satisfied now?"
145;1057200;1059600;"He still wants me to sit with him?"
146;1062710;1064870;"I shall not repeat myself."
147;1088060;1090440;"{\fad(1404,1)}Third Hand"

149;1098830;1101880;"I can no longer back down!"
150;1115740;1119110;"Are you really so eager to die?"
151;1128150;1129980;"From the King's perspective,"
152;1130270;1132130;"the wrath that was unleashed"
153;1132130;1136360;"was no stronger than that 
of a child throwing a fit."
154;1137120;1142740;"Yet it was violent enough to induce 
Netero to more than double the distance"
155;1142740;1145520;"between the King and him."
156;1147460;1150870;"It was an insult likened to laughing off"
157;1151590;1154460;"Netero's declaration that"
158;1155600;1157610;"he would not back down."
159;1162730;1163830;"Come on..."
160;1165000;1170260;"You will only influence me by using words."
161;1173120;1175270;"Damned newborn brat."
162;1178760;1182910;"If it were that simple, 
I wouldn't have to do this!"
163;1187960;1189010;"Wait..."
164;1190840;1192480;"By using..."
165;1192480;1193520;"words?"
166;1197810;1198990;"King..."
167;1201280;1204350;"Would you like to know your name?"
168;1207010;1210230;"How would you know my name?"
169;1216610;1221260;"My subordinates were present at the 
moment of your mother's passing."
170;1223480;1226980;"She uttered your name with her dying breath."
171;1228310;1233360;"And my subordinates may have died 
fighting your Royal Guard by now."
172;1240060;1242410;"Interested in fighting me now?"
173;1245980;1249750;"If you can force me to admit defeat,"
174;1249750;1252190;"I will tell you your name."
175;1254750;1256590;"Force you to admit defeat"
176;1256590;1259240;"without killing you?"
177;1263700;1266530;"So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap..."
178;1289510;1290780;"No matter."
179;1290780;1292980;"I shall checkmate you shortly."
180;1316210;1320500;"The real battle between Netero 
and the King has begun."
181;1404380;1406560;"Next time: Centipede x And x Memory."
182;1406560;1409020;"Hey, what do you want to be in your next life?"
183;1409020;1410460;"Uh, what do you want to be?"
184;1410460;1414140;"In my next life, I want to be me, 
and meet you again."
185;1414140;1415240;"Stupid!"
