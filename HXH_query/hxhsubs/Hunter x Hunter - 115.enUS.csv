2;8660;11150;"I'm over here, fool!"
3;15600;20310;"I'm telling him that there's one 
more enemy to worry about?"
4;21740;23250;"That's fine."
5;24040;27500;"That will serve to distract Youpi,"
6;27500;29990;"and it will save Shoot."

9;123610;126830;"Ikalgo didn't realize that the name 
he had spoken with full confidence"
10;127190;131160;"had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions,"
11;131430;134200;"as he headed beneath the palace"
12;134200;136670;"to search for Palm."
13;162980;164560;"Satellite Dragonflies!"
14;170860;174610;"Ikalgo knew Palm only through the 
information he had been given."
15;175280;177670;"However, he was already firm in his resolve"
16;177670;182610;"that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her."
17;184120;185870;"I'm gonna rescue her."
18;186370;188120;"Palm is a friend of a friend."
19;189600;190870;"That makes her a friend..."
20;191970;193620;"My friend!"
21;196900;200060;"Palm was risking her life."
22;200060;203430;"That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect."
23;210970;213340;"I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation."
24;215810;217000;"I want to help her..."
25;219370;221650;"Because I decided I would help her!"
26;224500;226660;"The elevator leading underground"
27;227140;230920;"was equipped with a security camera and a scale."
28;231290;232920;"After arriving underground,"
29;232920;235670;"it would confirm that there was nothing inside"
30;235670;237710;"before automatically returning to the surface."
31;238770;241320;"Any number of people could descend at once,"
32;241320;244180;"but only one could ascend at a time."
33;244180;248060;"And a pass code had to be entered."
34;248400;251830;"The eight-digit code varied per person, 
and could be used to identify"
35;251830;254190;"who had used the elevator."
36;254770;257680;"If the user's height and weight 
do not match the data"
37;257680;263390;"on record from the time the code 
was assigned, a warning sounded,"
38;263390;266150;"and the elevator became a prison."
39;267830;272200;"On the first entry of an incorrect code, 
a warning sounded, and the doors locked."
40;273380;277060;"Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted,"
41;277060;280690;"the elevator filled with sleeping gas, 
and the violator was captured and tortured."
42;281110;283700;"In other words, a third error meant death."
43;290170;296710;"Both the violator and the code's 
original owner would be killed,"
44;296990;300000;"making one's code as valuable as one's own life."
45;301480;304170;"And the only code holders"
46;304170;307630;"able to use the elevator without 
any such restriction"
47;307630;309870;"were Bizeff and Marcos."
48;311600;316290;"That was because the elevator 
was a more convenient means"
49;316290;319530;"of smuggling in various things, including humans,"
50;319530;322880;"than the cargo entrance, 
which was watched by soldiers."
51;337700;339700;"What is this smell?!"
52;340220;344280;"Has Flutter been living in the morgue?"
53;349150;353670;"I can also smell Bro, since he was"
54;353670;356050;"the last one in here before me."
55;357270;361290;"Damn, there's something else, very faint..."
56;362360;366360;"The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served"
57;366360;368580;"to dull Welfin's sense of smell."
58;369940;373180;"Since Bro followed Flutter underground,"
59;374180;378080;"he must have also noticed that Flutter 
used the name "Hagya-sama.""
60;379910;383490;"Or is Brovada conspiring with him?"
61;386580;389760;"When I was watching the intruder,"
62;391420;395000;"was Bro watching me from behind?"
63;398010;401930;"If he was, and if he's working with the intruder,"
64;401930;406380;"then he must have seen that 
I noticed Flutter's odd behavior..."
65;407170;411360;"So, he went down first..."
66;414370;418030;"In order to ambush me!"
67;421140;423390;"Damn, this is my chance!"
68;425260;427760;"Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously."
69;427760;431310;"If I can pass him off him as the 
bomb threat's perpetrator,"
70;432100;436250;"Bizeff will be indebted to me!"
71;437280;438250;"Bizeff!"
72;440890;442100;"Where's Bizeff?"
73;443510;444670;"This is bad..."
74;445830;450860;"If he dies during the attack, 
my plans will be ruined!"
75;451680;455870;"Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!"
76;463530;464560;"Yo."
77;465500;466710;"Grandpa..."
78;474140;475770;"He's changed."
79;479850;482960;"My job here is done."
80;483380;486290;"I know nothing beyond the mission I received."
81;489300;492930;"I'll let you draw your own conclusions 
about what's happening inside."
82;494340;495280;"Inside?"
83;500710;503420;"Swallowing the words he wanted to say,"
84;504290;506680;"Zeno disappeared into the darkness."
85;523540;528000;"Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,"
86;528650;534890;"Knuckle has revealed himself, a move 
that was not part of the original plan."
87;535990;538510;"Meleoron and Shoot"
88;539570;541370;"could only hold their breaths."
89;550060;552230;"Bring it!"
90;556700;558620;"Bring it!"
91;567710;571130;"I see... Then this is yours."
92;572620;573780;"It's time."
93;574300;575930;"Adding interest."
94;578650;580500;"The number increased?"
95;607410;609650;"My attacks won't work?"
96;610220;611790;"What is this thing?"
97;615160;616340;"Don't you run!"
98;616340;617550;"Answer me!"
99;618100;619530;"What is this thing?!"
100;624290;628610;"I ain't gonna tell you, fool!"
101;628610;631580;"If you wanna know, catch me first!"
102;643770;647580;"Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone..."
103;648240;653960;"I can't weave through those 
blades of death to get to him!"
104;655600;659790;"In that case, I'll walk at a pace 
that's neither fast nor slow,"
105;659790;663100;"to conserve as much oxygen as possible!"
106;691100;695610;"I must not lose consciousness..."
107;696010;698010;"If I pass out,"
108;699420;704010;"Hotel Rafflesia will stop..."
109;705470;712970;"Every little bit of damage counts..."
110;724920;729910;"I can still fight..."
111;731240;734520;"I can still..."
112;755530;759410;"I can't... I just can't say it!"
113;761160;764820;"I can't tell Shoot to keep fighting!"
114;772020;776330;"Right now, my job..."
115;777430;780300;"isn't to help Shoot!"
116;782970;786120;"It's to use my power to help the others,"
117;786120;790090;"so they can complete their 
missions as fast as possible!"
118;790970;793980;"You have to survive, Shoot!"
119;794830;797400;"Don't die!"
120;811790;813550;"No one's here."
121;817920;819520;"Stay calm..."
122;819520;821720;"Look around carefully."
123;824430;828640;"If I'm caught, I can still pretend 
to be on their side."
124;830010;831200;"However..."
125;831960;835860;"That might not work, depending on who I run into."
126;838330;841220;"Perfect Plan... Undo!"
127;849470;850410;"Okay!"
128;850910;851830;"Activate!"
129;861470;865960;"That's Morel's Smoky Jail."
130;865960;867270;"Which means..."
131;867800;872300;"Morel and Pouf are dueling it out in the throne 
room, with no possibility of interruption!"
132;873410;876280;"That only leaves..."
133;876670;878850;"Gon and Killua!"
134;882330;885780;"Where are they? Where are Gon and Killua?"
135;887090;889030;"Which way did they go?"
136;898920;900180;"Welfin?!"
137;901310;902330;"Crap!"
138;903340;905660;"He's tough to deal with..."
139;905660;908620;"He's the most skeptical of the Squadron Leaders!"
140;908620;912590;"Once he suspects you, he won't 
trust you again until you're dead!"
141;918400;922020;"I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?"
142;922480;924020;"Which way do I go?"
143;926470;928890;"What if he goes the same way?"
144;931080;932570;"Do I wait for him to leave?"
145;934340;936420;"Can I hold my breath that much longer?"
146;940760;943080;"No... I can't hold it!"
147;944340;945800;"I'm at my limit!"
148;958170;962170;"I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!"
149;962760;964960;"Perfect Plan, undo!"
150;969840;972580;"Now inhale..."
151;972580;973960;"Activate!"
152;978680;981790;"For a second, I sensed something."
153;991540;992460;"The enemy?"
154;994780;999850;"Welfin's power reflected his very nature,"
155;999850;1003300;"channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon."
156;1004980;1008520;"{\fad(900,1)}Egg Man 
<font size="20">Missile Man</font>"
157;1005810;1006900;"Missile Man!"
158;1009070;1011960;"If anyone's hiding behind the building,"
159;1011960;1015790;"surrender and show yourself by 
the time I count down from three!"
160;1016970;1019560;"If you don't, I'll attack!"
161;1024550;1025590;"Three!"
162;1028060;1029070;"Two!"
163;1031610;1032530;"One!"
164;1035640;1037340;"Fire!"
165;1050620;1053110;"No one's there... Did I imagine it?"
166;1054300;1058150;"To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target"
167;1058150;1061160;"and loads ammo in the form 
of questions or commands."
168;1061160;1065830;"If someone answers falsely or disobeys, 
the attack is launched."
169;1067210;1072840;"By the time Welfin noticed a presence, 
Meleoron had already moved."
170;1073360;1076640;"Had Meleoron stayed in the same place,"
171;1076640;1081900;"his attack would have succeeded, 
despite his inability to detect his target."
172;1082470;1086200;"Finding nothing fitting the target's 
description, the attack failed."
173;1088050;1093360;"Once fired, Missile Man will 
pursue its target until it hits."
174;1093920;1097500;"No one can survive the impact."
175;1098930;1104160;"However, Welfin understood that 
his ability wasn't omnipotent."
176;1104980;1108640;"His power was nothing more than a tool."
177;1109130;1113990;"Welfin was even skeptical of his own power."
178;1113990;1117800;"He sought to become the king behind the scenes,"
179;1117800;1123180;"because being the real king would mean
 he'd have too much to be suspicious of."
180;1124760;1126560;"It was my imagination?"
181;1128310;1130560;"No, wait..."
182;1135840;1138780;"I smell odorless deodorant..."
183;1140160;1142200;"You can't fool my nose."
184;1143100;1146310;"Someone was here! I know it!"
185;1146800;1150830;"Since I could only sense them for a moment, 
they must be very skilled."
186;1151790;1156730;"The use of deodorant confirms 
that they're aware of my nose."
187;1157320;1161470;"This confirms that there are traitors among us!"
188;1162950;1164900;"There are others besides Flutter?"
189;1165520;1167100;"The answer is probably yes!"
190;1167860;1170970;"And it's someone I know..."
191;1171420;1173890;"That's why they're hiding their scent."
192;1175470;1176400;"Who is it?"
193;1178130;1180160;"They don't want to fight me?"
194;1181840;1183740;"Because they can take me out at any time?"
195;1195610;1196570;"Do I..."
196;1197590;1198570;"Do I..."
197;1202650;1204280;"Do I really"
198;1204920;1207020;"want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?"
199;1208700;1211660;"Should I really be"
200;1213110;1216620;"searching for Bizeff now?"
201;1221310;1226490;"As Welfin began to doubt his own objectives..."
202;1262880;1268530;"Gon and Killua had finally found Neferpitou,"
