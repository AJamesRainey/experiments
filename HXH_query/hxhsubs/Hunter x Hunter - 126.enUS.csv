1;1700;3810;"This is a tomb."
2;8800;10480;"Your tomb."
3;29430;31250;"I am very thankful."
4;40100;42020;"Thankful for everything"
5;43120;45360;"that has made our meeting possible!"
6;128980;134020;"Zero x And x Rose"
7;196530;200630;"As his time was compressed to its utmost limits,"
8;200630;205370;"the King, his consciousness alone barely following 
the afterimages of Netero's movements,"
9;206840;209680;"found that a single emotion reigned within him..."
10;217620;221050;"Complete and utter admiration for his enemy."
11;239150;240010;"That's it."
12;241800;246550;"He brings his hands together to start the attack."
13;247090;250680;"That's the only motion he has 
that far surpasses my speed."
14;254040;259240;"Such wasted movement could 
cost one's life in battle,"
15;259240;262700;"but now, it works as a weapon 
that may allow him to defeat me."
16;263420;268950;"Trying to guess what drove 
him to do this is pointless."
17;269900;274460;"It would have required choosing 
a path that defies reason."
18;275150;280220;"I would presume that, at one point, 
he was on the verge of madness..."
19;282430;285530;"Five years... Perhaps ten years..."
20;291390;293980;"And the entire time, he focused on this alone."
21;316800;318050;"I recognize that"
22;320130;324640;"you have dedicated an incredible amount of time"
23;325130;328350;"to achieve the power you have displayed."
24;330140;333180;"After all that, he's barely been scratched."
25;333180;335300;"Not that I expected any different."
26;338710;340170;"An individual"
27;342310;345860;"can reach his limit after much training."
28;346490;350030;"You are a rare example of one 
who has transcended that limit."
29;353000;354140;"Bravo."
30;354840;356360;"You have earned my praise."
31;358390;360170;"An insect"
32;361610;365590;"should not talk down to humans!"
33;382540;385890;"The King's strategy was quite simple."
34;386670;388230;"Keep attacking."
35;389120;394080;"If the only attack capable of besting him, 
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva,"
36;394080;398510;"could do next to no damage, 
the King had no cause for fear."
37;401330;403530;"These are no more than dummy hands."
38;403940;406280;"They can only move in set patterns."
39;406950;411590;"If I attack from an angle that he can't 
block with a move he's already used,"
40;411590;414780;"he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move."
41;417350;420450;"Once I have verified all of the combinations,"
42;420450;427860;"I can find the angle of attack that will 
force him to reveal another new move."
43;431290;435100;"However, while he may have a limited 
number of attack patterns,"
44;435100;440120;"the number of combinations they can 
be used in may as well be infinite."
45;444210;448380;"But every individual has a rhythm."
46;449100;452780;"There will be an unconscious bias for, 
and against, certain patterns,"
47;453200;456620;"and that bias naturally shapes one's identity."
48;457480;460320;"If I can identify his personal rhythm,"
49;460320;466650;"I have a fair chance of guessing 
which patterns he will select."
50;467590;472400;"To find the single correct needle 
among countless millions,"
51;472400;475270;"and thread it accurately..."
52;476840;479560;"is what it will take to pierce my target."
53;479560;481780;"It may prove difficult..."
54;485420;486920;"But I will succeed."
55;488240;489700;"I can accomplish it!"
56;490930;493790;"Old soldier, I beg of you..."
57;494910;499230;"Don't lose your life before I succeed!"
58;502920;504690;"He's laughing?"
59;505120;508820;"Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him."
60;509840;512530;"No matter my attack trajectory,"
61;513070;517800;"he recovers immediately and moves to counter."
62;518680;525250;"If I make a wrong move, his speed won't 
allow me time to unleash the next Hand."
63;526570;533010;"If I lose focus, he'll tear me 
apart before I realize it."
64;534990;540390;"This is a contest of endurance, in which 
I must keep choosing correctly..."
65;541180;545470;"When I fail, you win."
66;548290;552480;"That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!"
67;552980;554160;"No matter."
68;554160;556010;"I shall checkmate you shortly."
69;557220;560160;"Checkmate me if you can."
70;561130;564240;"I'll show you my Zero Hand!"
71;592320;595280;"After hundreds and thousands of hits,"
72;595710;601330;"the King was beginning to feel the slightest 
hints of dull pain within his body."
73;602580;603470;"However..."
74;617260;618570;"Stop the bleeding."
75;619280;621260;"Then tell me my name."
76;621910;625920;"You have done well for a human."
77;635960;636900;"What's wrong?"
78;637330;640030;"If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss."
79;642180;643530;"Don't make me laugh."
80;654920;657050;"I'll die?"
81;657580;660640;"You shouldn't get cocky after 
landing a lucky punch..."
82;660640;662300;"The battle's just begun!"
83;663520;666030;"You have truly earned my admiration."
84;666530;670060;"I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged."
85;670970;675290;"However, losing your leg was basically inevitable."
86;675720;680570;"It is the consequence of using a defense that, 
while not bad, was not the best choice."
87;682650;687640;"After playing against Komugi, I learned 
the art of anticipating enemy actions."
88;689080;693960;"Your unconscious bias against certain patterns"
89;693960;698090;"gives me insight into the otherwise 
limitless options you have."
90;701250;704280;"Next, I'll take your left arm."
91;710590;712350;"The ensuing fight"
92;712750;715860;"did not even last a minute."
93;718860;719860;"This is"
94;721190;723060;"my life's final act!"
95;724160;727280;"As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve"
96;727800;731990;"heightened his physical and mental senses,"
97;736010;739170;"resulting in an exchange of more 
than a thousand punches,"
98;741410;745270;"and sparking countless fireworks 
between the combatants."
99;748000;752350;"And then, the moment arrived."
100;754560;757220;"His attacks began to show a slight inclination,"
101;757600;762860;"one not quite significant enough 
to be called a habit or bias."
102;763750;768490;"After using his body to bear the 
brunt of Netero's attacks,"
103;768490;773090;"the King was able to find 
the faint light beyond, and..."
104;775120;776550;"he reached it."
105;793130;796400;"Are you satisfied now?"
106;798880;802320;"Then tell me my name."
107;811650;813000;"Ant King..."
108;815110;818250;"You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?"
109;821380;825010;"A prayer comes from the heart."
110;833510;837370;"If the heart achieves the correct 
form, it becomes emotion..."
111;837370;839940;"And emotions may be manifested."
112;844460;847290;"100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand"
113;847290;850150;"was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy,"
114;852480;859020;"gently enveloping the target 
with an indiscriminate love."
115;867050;871560;"Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous 
intent from a great distance away."
116;871950;873310;"Not this way!"
117;874630;879750;"It had left such a strong impact, 
Killua had changed his direction."
118;881220;884150;"The entirety of Netero's aura"
119;885690;890480;"was transformed into a light as 
blinding as a star, and fired"
120;892410;894160;"with a merciless roar."
121;989830;992860;"The pinnacle of individual strength."
122;1011500;1013980;"That was a magnificent attack."
123;1015340;1017560;"Zero wasn't enough?"
124;1020060;1022750;"I was born to be King of the Ants,"
125;1023240;1026330;"to rule over all organisms."
126;1028270;1032670;"I represent the instinctive hope 
long nurtured by my species,"
127;1032670;1035820;"and that species continues to evolve for my sake."
128;1037070;1042790;"I stand here now, the resulting boon 
of the total support of my species."
129;1044680;1048130;"You are an individual human, not a king..."
130;1048530;1052010;"I am the King that bears his kind's fate."
131;1053030;1055700;"That was the difference in this battle."
132;1056950;1064570;"The Chimera Ants' long evolution 
has culminated in me."
133;1066080;1071710;"This is a feat the human race, with its 
individuality, can never match."
134;1072310;1076870;"However, humans will no longer 
be used to propagate our species."
135;1077870;1079940;"We have learned that"
136;1079940;1084220;"the strong human ego disrupts 
the bonds between Ants."
137;1085440;1087230;"Out of respect for your efforts,"
138;1087760;1091740;"I shall allow humans to permanently 
survive within a special zone."
139;1092510;1098240;"We shall reevaluate the number and 
quality of humans to be used as food."
140;1100420;1105000;"Your lonely battle was not in vain..."
141;1110770;1114400;"I shall not repeat myself again."
142;1115640;1117260;"Tell me my name."
143;1132580;1137330;"I am not alone."
144;1146380;1150540;"Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem."
145;1152120;1155780;"Meruem... That is your name."
146;1160020;1163370;"As Netero spoke the King's name,"
147;1164140;1167660;"the King had no time to consider it,"
148;1167660;1171090;"as he watched the old man who was 
supposed to be surrendering."
149;1172280;1174790;"What is this?"
150;1185280;1187520;"Meruem, King of Ants,"
151;1188290;1191080;"you understand nothing..."
152;1198990;1203340;"of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!"
153;1204920;1209790;"It was the first time the King had felt fear."
154;1210680;1216230;"One look at the face of this beaten old man, 
who should have been waiting for death,"
155;1216860;1224280;"made it clear that his seemingly 
vain words were no mere boast."
156;1235620;1240380;"Should your heart stop beating, this will activate."
157;1248300;1252140;"If there is a hell, I'll see you there."
158;1256430;1257690;"I see now..."
159;1258800;1260650;"Yes... I see..."
160;1263970;1265830;"You had me in checkmate"
161;1267180;1268480;"from the start..."
162;1288850;1293180;"The bomb was both low-budget and compact,"
163;1293180;1296290;"while also proving surprisingly lethal."
164;1297570;1300020;"With the right technology,"
165;1300530;1304010;"it was possible to quickly mass 
produce these bombs."
166;1304800;1307450;"Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,"
167;1309280;1313600;"it was called the Miniature Rose, 
or the poor man's rose,"
168;1313600;1316350;"and was popular with small dictatorships."
169;1404670;1407170;"Next time: Hostility x And x Determination."
170;1407170;1409790;"No matter what happens, 
I won't betray my friends."
171;1409790;1412250;"No matter what happens, 
I'll believe in my friends."
172;1412750;1415630;"Thank you, Chairman Netero."
