2;27430;28960;"But you still want to..."
3;30700;33900;"He was willing to abandon his own kid for it."
4;36220;39660;"That's how amazing it is to be a Hunter!"
5;42280;45560;"You really are his son..."
6;47500;53540;"The last test to be accepted 
by Ging-san is to find him."
7;54370;56940;"It's a task more difficult than any Hunt."
8;59360;63010;"As far as I know, he's the greatest Hunter there is."
9;66240;68170;"There's something that I want."
10;70250;74790;"He never told me what it 
was that he wanted."
11;76790;78550;"Catch me if you can."
12;79140;81970;"You are a Hunter, aren't you?"
13;102200;103270;"Ging..."
14;105000;110000;"Past x And x Future"
15;230640;232400;"You want to climb the tree?"
16;232400;235980;"No one under the age of eighteen 
can go beyond this point."
17;237330;241030;"Unless you have some special 
license or certification..."
18;243980;245220;"A pro Hunter?"
19;246130;247470;"At your age?"
20;248760;250140;"Excuse me, then."
21;250140;251260;"Go right ahead."
22;252460;254980;"But I'll need you to sign this first."
23;256580;259250;"Even a president would have to sign it."
24;259670;264990;"It's just the usual thing that says you 
don't care if you die during the climb."
25;279090;280750;"Here's some advice!"
26;281390;285260;"Don't trust any of the grips or footholds 
left behind by previous climbers."
27;286370;288990;"Those who make it to the top 
usually do it bare-handed."
28;288990;292050;"That's how the guy who's at 
the top right now did it."
29;294420;296520;"Got it! Thanks!"
30;296910;300320;"Well, if you feel you're in trouble, 
just press that button."
31;303640;305870;"Our rescue team is skilled."
32;306330;308670;"If you can hold on to the tree for ten minutes—"
33;309680;310910;"He fell?!"
34;311690;312790;"Hey!"
35;313610;315270;"Hey!"
36;318310;320570;"He's already up there?"
37;339590;341630;"I still have a long way to go..."
38;359990;361330;"This tree is incredible."
39;362030;364080;"I can entrust myself to it."
40;367540;369380;"The moment my fingers touch it,"
41;369980;372390;"I can feel that there's life there,"
42;373110;376070;"and that it flows throughout the entire tree."
43;381890;382720;"I can do this!"
44;383830;386450;"So long as I heed the tree's whispering as I climb..."
45;401890;404310;"Help..."
46;405970;409360;"Help me..."
47;443450;444760;"Almost there."
48;451550;453060;"The top looks funny."
49;481760;483100;"They're huge!"
50;485370;486980;"That scared me..."
51;489890;490740;"Hi!"
52;497040;497930;"Yo."
53;503220;504940;"I was tired of waiting."
54;507890;508890;"Ging..."
55;512480;516260;"How long did it take you to get 
here from the 500-meter point?"
56;516790;518220;"Uh..."
57;518760;520440;"Around twenty minutes?"
58;521080;524710;"Well, I guess that's acceptable for your first time..."
59;525140;525980;"Eat up."
60;528380;529270;"Yep!"
61;537300;538980;"Beautiful view, right?"
62;539660;542750;"On overcast days, it's like a sea of clouds."
63;542750;543650;"Yeah!"
64;547100;548290;"Hey, Ging..."
65;548680;549480;"Hmm?"
66;550000;551190;"Can I ask you something?"
67;551750;554990;"Sure. I might not give you an answer, though."
68;555920;558530;"What is it that you want?"
69;563410;568000;"That which I can't see in front of me right now."
70;569670;571500;"That which you can't see in front of you?"
71;583610;586560;"I wanted to become a Hunter because..."
72;587370;588300;"Shut up!"
73;594110;596570;"I wanted to become a Hunter because,"
74;597790;601490;"at the time, it was the most practical way"
75;602650;605580;"{\fad(1,934)}to get into the place I wanted to go."
76;606850;611760;"That place was used as a certain 
royal family's burial ground."
77;612880;615590;"To enter, you had to belong to 
a trustworthy organization,"
78;615590;617600;"and to agree never to speak of it."
79;618080;622290;"And you had to pay all expenses out of pocket."
80;623290;626850;"In other words, you couldn't really explore it at all."
81;628530;631320;"You won't find anyone willing to spend"
82;631320;634670;"the resources and receive nothing in return."
83;637090;639290;"But I saw it as my chance."
84;640170;642640;"If I became a trusted pro Hunter,"
85;642640;644820;"getting the money wouldn't be a problem."
86;646120;647720;"When I turned fifteen,"
87;647720;651040;"I set up a special nonprofit organization"
88;651560;654090;"to explore and repair the tomb."
89;655100;659040;"Before that, I'd spent the two 
years after getting my license"
90;659040;663450;"surfing archaeology buffs' websites and blogs online."
91;666010;671020;"To create the nonprofit, I needed about ten oddballs"
92;671680;676770;"who didn't need money or fame, 
but only wanted to know the truth,"
93;677470;679690;"and who could be trusted to keep secrets."
94;683310;686760;"I'm always going after what I need."
95;687830;693510;"I'm so focused, I stop caring about 
the ultimate goal that lies beyond."
96;697680;699360;"Too hard to understand?"
97;699960;702050;"Then I guess I'll keep going."
98;706770;710230;"The people I recruited online and 
befriended in offline meetings"
99;710640;712810;"were all older than me."
100;713200;717260;"They were regular office workers, 
graduate students, and job-hoppers."
101;719420;722100;"After I told them my background and plan,"
102;722100;727120;"they helped with the various tasks 
to create the nonprofit,"
103;727120;729940;"and they even gave donations 
from what little money they had."
104;732700;736270;"When our dream was realized and 
we stepped inside for the first time,"
105;737150;739300;"the best part for me"
106;740730;745000;"wasn't when I finally witnessed the truth of the tomb."
107;746930;749230;"It was when I looked"
108;749960;753850;"at my colleagues' faces and shook their hands."
109;764840;769230;"To this day, they still work for the 
nonprofit with zero compensation,"
110;769750;771620;"providing me with viable information."
111;773040;775000;"The secret of the tomb"
112;775900;778610;"was nothing compared to the relationships I built."
113;780190;785560;"What was truly important came 
to me before what I wanted."
114;804380;805450;"And now?"
115;806060;806900;"Huh?"
116;807830;809650;"What are you after now?"
117;810100;811490;"Right now?"
118;812330;814720;"It'll take some time to explain..."
119;816060;817060;"Gon,"
120;817750;820090;"what is this tree we just climbed?"
121;820090;822770;"Huh? It's the World Tree."
122;822770;823860;"That's right."
123;825090;828430;"Down below, how did they describe the tree?"
124;828870;833930;"At 1,784 meters, it's the world's tallest tree."
125;836040;839180;"Technically, that's right."
126;840680;842630;"But the truth is that this tree"
127;843380;845690;"is a young sapling that's stopped growing."
128;847450;849890;"A World Tree that"
129;849890;853450;"didn't receive enough nutrition, 
and could only grow this tall."
130;867240;869210;"A real World Tree"
131;869790;871270;"would take in magma,"
132;871890;873530;"embed its roots in the mountains,"
133;874420;878270;"and continue to grow after leaving the atmosphere."
134;880260;883220;"Outside this world."
135;884560;886610;"This world?"
136;887350;890110;"The world map that you're familiar with."
137;900820;903540;"The Ants that you and the chairman fought"
138;903930;906300;"were a non-native species from outside this world."
139;907300;909800;"That's the truth they don't teach you in school."
140;911510;913440;"Adults with common sense"
141;913960;916790;"choose not to go near Pandora's Box."
142;929040;931280;"In other words, the world that we know"
143;932300;937600;"is nothing but a small part of a much bigger world."
144;940990;944120;"There are records showing that a chosen few,"
145;944760;948640;"from a select time and place, 
were able to make it outside."
146;952160;953210;"Understand now?"
147;955050;959100;"I still want the same thing I always have."
148;961590;964440;"Something that I can't see in front of me."
149;982690;985530;"There are many requirements to go outside."
150;986480;989710;"At least four are required before 
you can even start the journey."
151;990930;991780;"Authorization,"
152;992390;993220;"the means,"
153;994120;995210;"qualification,"
154;995960;997220;"a contract."
155;998500;1002450;"I still haven't obtained a single one."
156;1003060;1004870;"But I'm in no rush."
157;1005660;1007900;"I'm enjoying the journey."
158;1008410;1013560;"So if our paths happen to cross in the future..."
159;1014810;1016740;"You should enjoy the little detours."
160;1018060;1019360;"To the fullest."
161;1022180;1024790;"Because that's where you'll find the things"
162;1025300;1027730;"more important than what you want."
163;1051360;1052230;"Oh!"
164;1054890;1055720;"Ging..."
165;1057710;1058590;"Here."
166;1059500;1063580;"Kite asked me to return this to you."
167;1064830;1066640;"Oh, okay."
168;1081780;1085310;"The scar's still on my shoulder."
169;1085970;1088410;"See? Right here."
170;1090180;1093560;"And then, there was a huge boom!"
171;1096570;1100530;"And what popped out was 
another coffin, just this big."
172;1101910;1107350;"They're called the Testing Gates, 
and you have to open them to go inside."
173;1344630;1349550;"{\fad(1000,876)}Marshal"
