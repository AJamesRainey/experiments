85;410660;412740;"and he won't force me to stop."
86;413480;417300;"However, he's wary of Alluka's power."
87;418100;420120;"Which makes sense, given that one wrong move"
88;420120;423050;"is all it takes for the entire family to die."
89;423050;427530;"But on the other hand, 
he wishes to control Alluka's power."
90;428260;433790;"That dilemma shows in his decision to 
lock her up in a room filled with toys."
91;434620;440300;"That's why he had Tsubone and Amane, 
his most trusted butlers, accompany us."
92;441080;444150;"If something happens, they can 
take us back immediately."
93;444150;448930;"And he hopes they'll glean some hint 
to help him control Alluka."
94;449880;452080;"Tsubone and Amane understand their role,"
95;452630;454530;"and they're being very cautious."
96;455520;459090;"Gotoh and Canary are being subtle,"
97;459090;461750;"but they're on our side and helping us."
98;468720;470020;"And then,"
99;471290;472400;"there's Illumi."
100;475620;480380;"The moment his name was spoken, 
Amane's tension spiked."
101;481010;484310;"This means Amane and Tsubone,"
102;484310;487230;"and Father and Grandpa by extension,"
103;487230;488920;"disagree with Illumi."
104;490890;494520;"I'd guess that Illumi's plans for Alluka are..."
105;497770;499800;"That was a fine play, Gotoh."
106;500230;503940;"You threw out his name to see Amane's reaction."
107;505020;506600;"If Tsubone were here,"
108;506600;510180;"she would have noticed Gotoh's reaction 
when he answered the phone,"
109;510180;515430;"and she'd have distracted me or signaled 
Amane to shut off her emotions."
110;519160;520830;"This is an internal family struggle,"
111;521600;523080;"an inner mission."
112;524710;528610;"When family members differ 
in opinion or objective,"
113;528610;534930;"they're each encouraged to do things their 
own way, rather than unite in the same goal."
114;536060;537590;"This is a contest!"
115;539220;543790;"Father and Grandpa want Alluka 
near, so they can control her,"
116;543790;547980;"and they don't want me hurt by her power."
117;549180;550020;"I want"
118;552380;553800;"to save Gon"
119;555700;557780;"and to set Alluka free."
120;561770;563000;"And..."
121;564370;565560;"Illumi wants"
122;569000;570930;"to kill Alluka!"
123;571970;573130;"Is this Killua?"
124;573970;574750;"Yeah."
125;577710;580270;"You removed the needle, didn't you?"
126;581510;582430;"Yeah."
127;582960;584350;"I feel a lot better."
128;585760;588770;"Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you."
129;589090;590240;"Kill?"
130;591020;592060;"Me?"
131;595480;599400;"You can't kill family members 
during an inner mission."
132;601210;602930;"<i>Family</i> is off limits."
133;606120;608120;"Hey, hey, Amane..."
134;608120;611310;"Isn't this part great?"
135;612170;616050;"Why is this story so mysterious?"
136;620830;622730;"Is that what"
137;624210;625570;"Father meant?"
138;627550;631030;"You shouldn't consider that thing 
to be a member of the family."
139;634180;636190;"They're all thinking"
140;637690;639490;"the same thing!"
141;641520;643050;"Fine..."
142;643050;644940;"I'll beat you at your own game."
143;655400;657630;"Then, let's begin."
144;687570;688290;"Master Killua!"
145;689080;690720;"Don't let go of Master Alluka!"
146;690720;692670;"Yeah, I got her."
147;693410;696080;"If you two are more than a meter apart,"
148;696080;698290;"Amane will capture Master Alluka,"
149;698290;701430;"and Tsubone will take you home by force!"
150;753990;755980;"Oh, dear."
151;766630;768990;"That was excessive."
152;769750;771750;"I thought you were going to ask him first."
153;772770;777150;"I have a little bird who brings me information."
154;777150;779180;"And after examining that information,"
155;779930;781970;"there's something that bothers me."
156;785700;788290;"Killua is hiding rules from us."
157;790880;793750;"If there are rules I don't know about,"
158;793750;797990;"trying to negotiate with him is pointless."
159;799530;804180;"He might accede to my demands 
because they favor him."
160;805050;809070;"So I'll dispose of Alluka before he has 
a chance to use that advantage."
161;811430;814230;"I just need you to eliminate the butlers"
162;814230;818580;"while you look for a chance 
to take Alluka from Killua."
163;819110;820200;"For now."
164;820840;822340;"Okay."
165;823280;824600;"By the way,"
166;825640;828840;"am I allowed to kill Killua?"
167;832840;834240;"I will"
168;835310;836810;"kill you."
169;837770;839150;"Right here."
170;840640;841930;"Right now."
171;844220;846530;"I was kidding."
172;848440;851520;"You're oozing bloodlust."
173;852250;853490;"Is that all right?"
174;855280;856780;"Illumi's bloodlust!"
175;860230;862140;"Oh, damn."
176;863630;866300;"Was that on purpose?"
177;867590;868890;"Certainly not."
178;870640;875430;"If at all possible, I'd like Gon to live."
179;877280;881960;"Having more toys is always more amusing."
180;889260;890380;"Well,"
181;891190;892980;"only if it's possible."
182;895490;898960;"It's okay. Brother's got you."
183;898960;901580;"Keep your eyes closed and hold on tight."
184;902030;902840;"Uh-huh."
185;903470;906590;"Try to stay away from Master Illumi."
186;907000;911840;"If he knows the route we're taking, 
it's best to change directions."
187;917330;920350;"I concur, but..."
188;920920;924430;"It's hard for me to agree with you."
189;925330;928710;"My grandmother and I are not your enemies."
190;928710;930610;"Not right now."
191;930960;933620;"But that could change if my 
father's mood changes."
192;934000;937790;"Master Silva and Master Zeno 
are not your enemies."
193;938550;943630;"Our mission is to bring you home safely."
194;948880;951490;"If that doesn't include Alluka,"
195;954460;956640;"you're all enemies."
196;957590;958630;"Godspeed!"
197;959130;960590;"Speed of Lightning!"
198;967540;970870;"It's me. The situation's changed."
199;971360;972980;"We've been separated from Master Killua."
200;974300;976130;"We'll need four vehicles now."
201;976490;977820;"We'll follow the same route."
202;978790;981120;"If Master Killua contacts you,"
203;981120;984040;"follow his instructions, but avoid 
any sensitive information."
204;985030;987670;"Master Illumi is aware of our movements."
205;988400;991170;"One of the butlers or a family 
member is helping him."
206;991670;994620;"Be sure to stay alert."
207;995480;996800;"Understood."
208;1019240;1020860;"Ah..."
209;1021570;1025460;"You've grown, Master."
210;1027160;1029690;"If I hadn't known about that 
technique beforehand,"
211;1029690;1031210;"I wouldn't have had time to react."
212;1032110;1035160;"He will become an excellent assassin."
213;1035900;1039140;"Oh, dear. These days, it doesn't 
take much for me to tear up."
214;1040220;1044230;"In that case, he won't let Master 
Illumi get the better of him."
215;1044800;1046910;"I shouldn't say that."
216;1046910;1049300;"But I find it difficult to like Master Illumi"
217;1049300;1052480;"and Master Milluki, who resemble their mother."
218;1053400;1055200;"Now, then..."
219;1055490;1057760;"Time to set aside personal emotion."
220;1057760;1060490;"If he breaks the rules, everything changes."
221;1061380;1065510;"I need to devise a way to subdue Master Killua,"
222;1065510;1069550;"taking his speed into account."
223;1074430;1079050;"Okay! We should be far enough 
away to take a break."
224;1080090;1082860;"I'd like to use Speed of Lightning to keep going,"
225;1082860;1087640;"but to be safe, I should save my 
energy for getting into town."
226;1088180;1089770;"Brother?"
227;1093400;1096190;"Am I a nuisance?"
228;1103100;1106790;"If I were gone, would everyone get along better?"
229;1117970;1119180;"Alluka."
230;1120980;1122300;"If..."
231;1125580;1131410;"I were the only person in the 
world who really loved you,"
232;1132860;1133820;"would you be sad?"
233;1151350;1155550;"I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling."
234;1156800;1157760;"Okay?"
235;1158190;1161370;"I'll always be with you!"
236;1164870;1169000;"You don't need to worry about anyone else."
237;1175250;1176310;"Someone's there."
238;1177660;1178870;"Is it Tsubone?"
239;1180310;1181460;"Is it Illumi?"
240;1182940;1185100;"I guess this won't be easy."
241;1185100;1186370;"That's fine!"
242;1189220;1190270;"Let's go."
243;1194470;1196160;"Who are you?"
244;1197570;1201130;"A magician who wishes to stay anonymous."
245;1229200;1230920;"You two"
246;1231880;1234380;"shouldn't be trying to fight back."
247;1235430;1237090;"Just evade his attacks."
248;1237640;1240210;"Save your energy for the mission at hand."
249;1241180;1243040;"You should follow Master Killua."
250;1248240;1250470;"I'll play with you."
251;1253180;1257730;"A power that lets you rapidly fire coins 
with more power than bullets..."
252;1259740;1263990;"Your power is strong enough to explain why 
you'd send your subordinates away."
253;1264710;1269300;"My coins pack enough power that you 
can't escape unscathed if they hit."
254;1269870;1272350;"He must have used his power."
255;1286580;1292020;"My aura possesses the qualities 
of both gum and rubber."
