1;16460;21230;"I saw him back at the staircase..."
2;24010;25870;"Did he do it?"
3;27180;30780;"Sorry, but what's about to happen is"
4;30780;33510;"just me blowing off some steam."
5;121970;126980;"Strong x Or x Weak"
6;136880;137820;"He disappeared?"
7;169050;170140;"Godspeed."
8;172250;176960;"The difference in initial action 
speed was so overwhelming"
9;176960;181160;"that Youpi had no time to 
make a sound or transform."
10;182190;186880;"Killua's Godspeed placed an 
electrical burden upon his own body,"
11;186880;190410;"making it possible for his body to 
perform at a level far beyond"
12;190410;192260;"what should have been possible."
13;196200;200980;"Killua had divided this power 
into two different abilities:"
14;202350;206040;"Speed of Lightning, which allowed 
him to control his body at will,"
15;203950;206450;"Speed of Lightning"
16;206040;211710;"and Whirlwind, which allowed his body 
to react automatically to his opponent."
17;209700;212460;"Whirlwind"
18;212900;218480;"In a previous fight, he'd used the 
latter to stop his opponent's dart."
19;219560;222400;"A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response"
20;222400;225690;"to vibrations in aura that 
indicate the opponent's hostility."
21;226210;228050;"The attack bypasses commands from his brain,"
22;228050;232620;"unleashing attacks that transcend his 
own limits by relying on reflexes alone,"
23;232620;236570;"allowing him to easily surpass 
his opponent's physical speed."
24;237610;240880;"What's going on here?"
25;241590;248310;"All of these guys have less than 
ten percent of my raw power."
26;248780;250820;"This makes no sense..."
27;251940;254190;"I can't do a thing against him."
28;259560;261490;"Whirlwind!"
29;264920;266520;"Profound..."
30;268080;272030;"This "aura" stuff is intense..."
31;276000;278550;"This is getting interesting."
32;279570;285010;"Before my explosion, I never would 
have enjoyed fighting an uphill battle."
33;285740;291260;"Youpi's change in heart would lead him 
to make an unbelievable choice,"
34;291260;293520;"but this would not happen until later."
35;298740;300090;"Crap!"
36;301470;303530;"I used it all up!"
37;303810;304780;"Hold it!"
38;305380;307500;"You're not getting away!"
39;308370;311330;"You're seeing this through with me..."
40;311330;313370;"Until you die!"
41;317620;318640;"He disappeared?"
42;319270;320760;"Again."
43;320760;325050;"He vanished, as though he were 
never here to begin with."
44;326310;327560;"That's it..."
45;328800;332410;"At least one of them must have the ability"
46;333350;336550;"to make people appear and disappear at will."
47;343390;344320;"Huh?"
48;345630;348280;"Please enter your passcode."
49;349360;352660;"Damn, I didn't get a code."
50;359430;361840;"Your passcode and name do not match."
51;362510;364930;"Please reenter your passcode."
52;365640;369840;"A second input error will result in your restraint."
53;370630;374720;"He came down here without a passcode?"
54;375290;379490;"Okay... Guess I'll have to step out."
55;380590;382740;"The door has been locked."
56;382740;385230;"Please enter your passcode."
57;386850;387900;"This is my chance!"
58;388530;390100;"I have two options."
59;391410;394510;"The elevator will fill with 
sleeping gas eventually."
60;395020;397240;"Once he's asleep, I have to decide."
61;398230;402130;"One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,"
62;402500;406510;"Monitor Room"
63;402780;405780;"and head for the surface through the cargo entrance."
64;407470;411750;"This way, when he wakes up, 
he'll still be stuck in the elevator."
65;412260;415730;"But there's a high risk that someone above 
will notice that the elevator isn't coming up."
66;417010;420900;"Two, I move Brovada somewhere 
else while he's asleep."
67;422420;424270;"There are plenty of trucks parked around."
68;425270;429280;"And the warehouse doors require a 
passcode to open from the inside."
69;429960;432910;"When he wakes up, Brovada won't 
be able to open them."
70;433880;437410;"And if I use the cargo entrance 
to return to the surface,"
71;438310;443920;"the risk that I'll encounter enemies will 
be much lower than if I take the elevator."
72;446080;448800;"No! That won't work!"
73;449790;452070;"I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!"
74;452070;453680;"That's the safest option!"
75;454190;459930;"Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse, 
and use it to take out other Squadron Leaders."
76;460550;461930;"That's the least it'll take!"
77;465120;470270;"I'll stick the barrel of my gun through 
the gap in his armor and open fire."
78;473020;476430;"Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies,"
79;476430;480200;"but he had never killed anyone 
with his own hands before."
80;481080;484320;"Enter your passcode at once."
81;484850;488460;"If a passcode is not entered 
within thirty seconds,"
82;488780;490810;"the restraining process will begin."
83;494340;496220;"The monitor room in the border guard area..."
84;497070;499470;"There should be a monitor 
for the elevator camera,"
85;499470;501450;"and a button to open the doors!"
86;528860;531630;"Well, I'm outside now,"
87;531630;534300;"but I had to destroy the elevator..."
88;534810;537030;"Is there another exit?"
89;540160;541420;"I was naïve..."
90;541940;543580;"I didn't expect him to shoot the door."
91;544740;545680;"What now?"
92;546080;549690;"Do I wait for him to lower his guard, 
then sneak out the cargo entrance?"
93;550810;553810;"Or do I wait for him to leave?"
94;555680;559330;"Either way, if he goes back to the surface..."
95;561560;563390;"That's not good enough!"
96;564640;566030;"I'm being naïve!"
97;567000;568840;"If he returns to the surface,"
98;568840;572000;"and tells the others that Flutter's dead,"
99;572000;573820;"I'll be able to move around freely!"
100;576340;577340;"Am I an idiot?"
101;578470;584000;"If I allow an enemy to return to the surface, 
I'm putting everyone else in more danger."
102;606260;608160;"This one's tough."
103;629010;631270;"I can't let him go back up..."
104;631780;635280;"If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!"
105;653500;655240;"Yes, this way!"
106;655890;658300;"I'm gonna trap you."
107;676770;677990;"A little farther..."
108;679520;681310;"Wait until he's a little farther from it..."
109;692610;693330;"Now!"
110;706420;710080;"So there was someone besides Flutter..."
111;710080;714100;"Looks like you were trying to lure me in there..."
112;716240;718110;"Too bad for you."
113;718470;723910;"If only one path remains, it's too good 
to be true. Anyone would be suspicious."
114;724480;728120;"Well, now I know about you."
115;730370;735880;"And I bet you're hiding in the 
monitor room to watch me, chicken!"
116;736290;737520;"Damn..."
117;738100;741250;"I could have completely 
trapped him in that hallway..."
118;742450;745390;"But there's no way out from where he is now."
119;746120;748400;"He's still trapped."
120;749610;752250;"Sleeping gas will eventually 
fill the room, and he'll..."
121;753900;756340;"Crap! He isn't trapped!"
122;756340;757650;"There's a way out!"
123;758930;761630;"I should get out of here..."
124;761630;764110;"That's probably sleeping gas."
125;765520;768780;"I have to do something before he realizes."
126;770920;771900;"I know..."
127;772300;773810;"The armored vehicles in the garage."
128;774370;776200;"With those, I could at least lock him in."
129;776570;779780;"But then I'll have no way to get 
back to the surface, either!"
130;780910;782430;"Think..."
131;782430;784680;"Is there anything I can use here?"
132;785500;788180;"Come up with the best possible plan, fast!"
133;790630;794610;"I guess I have to blow through this shutter..."
134;794610;796440;"How annoying!"
135;801010;802630;"I have to do this!"
136;810540;814300;"Damn! All that firing, and I 
barely scorched the surface?"
137;814860;817780;"Guess I'll need to think of something else..."
138;818260;819280;"I know!"
139;820440;823210;"You can operate the shutters 
from the monitor room,"
140;820440;823210;"Monitor Room"
141;823210;825810;"so I can go there to open the shutters."
142;826420;828330;"Nice idea!"
143;828660;829470;"Wait,"
144;830180;833440;"I have to go through the shutters 
to reach the monitor room."
145;834320;840250;"Damn, so I have to get through these 
shutters to return to the surface?"
146;841120;842480;"Wait..."
147;843660;844990;"There might be a way"
148;846040;848810;"to escape without busting down the shutters."
149;853980;855800;"The shutter's opening?"
150;862620;864310;"An armored vehicle?"
151;865350;868010;"That's something a chicken would use."
152;868720;871150;"But the shutter behind it is still shut."
153;872050;875130;"The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter."
154;876180;877910;"Which means that..."
155;877910;879520;"First,"
156;879900;885220;"he closed the front shutter and 
parked the vehicle there."
157;885220;886950;"Then he returned to the monitor room,"
158;886950;889530;"and started raising the front shutter"
159;889530;895290;"and lowering the back one, 
before racing back to the vehicle?"
160;896040;898690;"Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?"
161;899970;904270;"He closed off his only escape 
route, just to finish me off?"
162;905690;908940;"Heh... Yeah, right."
163;911630;914700;"So there's more than one..."
164;914700;917930;"The other's watching in the monitor room."
165;917930;919390;"Pisses me off!"
166;921230;924060;"Watch this, you peeping tom..."
167;924350;927820;"I'm gonna drag your buddy 
out of the armored vehicle"
168;927820;930320;"and rip him to shreds!"
169;932350;934040;"I'm the only one here."
170;935120;937670;"I have to do something..."
171;937670;939080;"By myself!"
172;944980;946340;"That's tough armor!"
173;962520;963600;"I did it!"
174;967150;970930;"Crap! He blocked the elevator!"
175;970930;976100;"I could have blown a hole in the 
ceiling, and climbed up the wire!"
176;979980;981590;"I've blocked his escape route."
177;982070;983570;"First hurdle cleared!"
178;991260;994130;"You have guts to show yourself..."
179;994130;996300;"I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!"
180;1003890;1005150;"Smoke?"
181;1012790;1014150;"Did he kill himself?"
182;1014150;1015690;"Miss his chance to escape?"
183;1015690;1018520;"Either way, there's no way to move this thing!"
184;1019150;1020800;"There's only a few centimeters of space."
185;1020800;1023130;"The elevator's completely blocked!"
186;1034360;1037680;"Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!"
187;1038100;1039680;"If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!"
188;1040160;1041950;"Open the damned shutter!"
189;1041950;1043870;"You hear me?"
190;1046260;1049600;"Being an octopus, I only need a few 
centimeters to squeeze through."
191;1050650;1052320;"Second hurdle cleared."
192;1053930;1055200;"Hey!"
193;1055200;1057160;"Open the shutter!"
194;1061330;1065610;"Now, I just have to wait for the 
sleeping gas to fill the room."
195;1074270;1075850;"I can hold my breath,"
196;1075850;1078840;"but I don't want to waste time."
197;1078840;1081200;"Wait for the right timing!"
198;1101570;1103830;"Third hurdle cleared."
199;1110010;1111300;"Be patient."
200;1112760;1114320;"Nice and slow."
201;1127900;1130390;"This is the final hurdle."
202;1131940;1134020;"I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done."
203;1143300;1145870;"Fire! This is the best option!"
204;1146450;1149870;"I'll be safest if I control his body 
and return to the surface!"
205;1150560;1152880;"Which means I have to kill him..."
206;1153580;1155880;"I'm the only one here."
207;1156520;1160380;"There's no one else to help me!"
208;1160950;1162590;"I h-have to..."
209;1164190;1165250;"kill him!"
210;1195860;1197200;"I can't do it!"
211;1198180;1199460;"I'm..."
212;1201470;1202590;"I'm..."
213;1203260;1206340;"just a coward!"
214;1212950;1217480;"While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness..."
215;1218110;1224500;"Within the shifted central tower, 
as Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon,"
216;1224500;1228580;"he was battling doubts of his own, as well."
217;1229330;1230430;"Hold on."
218;1231130;1232080;"What if..."
219;1232660;1235190;"Pitou! Pouf!"
220;1235770;1237160;"Are you there?"
221;1237160;1238300;"Hey!"
222;1239420;1244330;"What if it isn't that he chose 
not to respond to Youpi,"
223;1244870;1247360;"but that he wasn't able to respond?"
224;1249180;1251770;"Within the cocoon should be
nothing but a goopy mess."
225;1251770;1254420;"He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet."
226;1255670;1261430;"If he's utterly defenseless 
while he changes forms,"
227;1261430;1262790;"this is the time to attack."
228;1265410;1272270;"Would he really make such a literally 
fatal mistake in this situation?"
229;1273980;1275530;"It's not possible!"
230;1275530;1279420;"This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap."
231;1280760;1286380;"But the question is whether the 
trap activates when I attack,"
232;1287100;1291390;"or if it's already been activated, 
before I've even attacked."
233;1292570;1293750;"Which is it?"
234;1296330;1301400;"You have doubts because you 
are good at what you do."
235;1302670;1306970;"However, that is all there is to it."
236;1311830;1315510;"Attack? Don't attack?"
237;1317180;1318380;"What do I do?"
238;1404630;1406840;"Next time: Fake x And x Real."
239;1406840;1409320;"Hey... If not now, when?"
240;1410270;1411920;"Not yet!"
241;1411920;1414060;"You're a fake. You aren't Killua."
