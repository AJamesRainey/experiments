5;101480;103830;"After using Accompany,"
6;103830;108040;"Gon and Killua were transported 
to Ging's student, Kite."
7;108760;112450;"After Gon remembered having 
met Kite years before,"
8;112450;115120;"he felt that Ging intended 
for this meeting to occur,"
9;115120;117410;"and his interest in Kite grew."
10;119360;122190;"Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?"
11;122190;123810;"Biological surveying."
12;124130;127810;"I focus on discovering and 
researching new species."
13;128150;130360;"Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?"
14;131320;132820;"Camp Tiger?"
15;133250;134950;"They can use fire."
16;135270;138320;"They use branches that have been 
ignited by lightning as live kindle."
17;139310;142670;"Other than certain Magical 
Beasts that walk on two legs,"
18;142670;144150;"they're the first of their kind:"
19;144550;147830;"animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw."
20;148200;150470;"Wow, they're really cooking it."
21;150470;152110;"They really are using fire!"
22;152660;154120;"Hey, what else is there?"
23;154640;155840;"Oh, yeah..."
24;156430;159680;"You said the thing that attacked 
me was a Chimera Ant?"
25;160630;162710;"Yes, a Chimera Ant."
26;164180;166720;"Under a class-1 quarantine."
27;166720;170910;"Normally, no one would be allowed 
near such a dangerous insect."
28;171240;173360;"Did you discover them?"
29;173360;176640;"No, I specialize in larger creatures."
30;176930;179360;"But currently, I'm investigating these insects."
31;180380;182610;"Something has been bothering me..."
32;187170;191620;"But it appears that now, I'll have 
to move to a different location."
33;192300;195630;"I must make a call, but I'm not 
getting any reception here."
34;195940;197060;"A call?"
35;197650;199230;"I'm working with others."
36;199230;201130;"Seven of us are working as a team."
37;201620;204220;"I guess I must wait for their arrival."
38;204660;206410;"Once they're here, I'll introduce you."
39;206410;209390;"They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters."
40;214160;216040;"Oh?"
41;216700;218750;"Ah, speak of the devil."
42;222000;224690;"Kite, who are these kids?"
43;224690;226100;"My friends."
44;226370;228410;"They dropped by for a visit on their travels."
45;229000;231870;"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet 
you all the way out here."
46;231870;233790;"I'm Spinner Clow."
47;233790;235230;"Call me Spin!"
48;235230;236200;"Nice to meet you."
49;236540;238210;"I'm Gon Freecss."
50;238210;239800;"Nice to meet you, Spin."
51;241020;242710;"Freecss..."
52;243010;244610;"Wait, is this..."
53;245410;247640;"Yes, Ging-san's son."
54;247640;249010;"Really?!"
55;249010;251390;"And you? Not you, too?"
56;251660;253500;"No, not me."
57;253500;255150;"My name is Killua Zoldyck."
58;255650;257510;"Zoldyck..."
59;257510;262650;"Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you 
part of the famous family of assassins?"
60;262900;265400;"Yeah, but I quit."
61;265950;268280;"Additionally, they are both pro Hunters."
62;268600;270660;"So you should show some respect."
63;270660;272770;"Wow!"
64;275510;277670;"Man, that was a shock!"
65;278290;281960;"We've been conducting biological 
surveys with Kite for three years,"
66;281960;285330;"but this is the most incredible 
organism we've ever seen!"
67;285330;287180;"Yeah, no kidding..."
68;287610;289770;"I don't think we finished our introductions."
69;290210;292120;"I'm Monta Yuras."
70;292120;293430;"But call me Mon."
71;293430;295190;"Nice to meet you, Mon."
72;295460;297320;"I'm Stick Dinner."
73;297320;298820;"I handle the cooking."
74;298820;299710;"Know why?"
75;299710;301390;"Because my name is Dinner."
76;303870;305070;"Nice meeting you."
77;305490;307980;"My name is Banana Kavaro."
78;308360;309270;"Good to meet you."
79;313130;315740;"We have two others on our team."
80;315740;317330;"Where are Podungo and Lin?"
81;317640;320590;"They're both headed toward 
the area of the sighting."
82;320590;322880;"They always move so fast."
83;322880;326220;"Oh, and you were right, Kite..."
84;327820;333160;"This looks just like the claw 
of a Chimera Ant queen."
85;335960;340980;"We ran some computer analyses, 
and the result was a 99% match."
86;341410;342370;"Can I see it?"
87;342370;343280;"Sure."
88;345450;348120;"This is a Chimera Ant claw?"
89;348120;349850;"It's as big as a human finger."
90;350230;352240;"Does that mean there are huge ants?"
91;352570;353990;"We don't know."
92;353990;356220;"Maybe one mutated and grew really big?"
93;356220;360710;"That's possible, though it may also belong 
to a completely different species."
94;361590;364380;"Regardless, we just don't know right now."
95;365130;366980;"That's why we're investigating."
96;368660;371330;"It all started with the wonkiest little thing..."
97;371330;373260;"His name was Won!"
98;373260;375050;"He was a Kakin official."
99;376740;378380;"What's Kakin?"
100;378380;379370;"Right here."
101;379370;383420;"It's this wild land, in the middle 
of the Azian continent."
102;383790;387310;"We had just completed a biological 
survey they had requested when..."
103;389520;391030;"Magnificent."
104;391420;395600;"You've completed two hundred years' 
worth of work for this agency..."
105;395600;399690;"To be honest, I regret that I am 
unable to pay you a bonus."
106;399690;401370;"Don't say that, Won-san."
107;401370;402920;"We enjoyed ourselves."
108;403540;405830;"In lieu of that,"
109;405830;410430;"I'll be sure to recommend you 
to other friendly nations."
110;410800;412300;"We appreciate it."
111;414530;416450;"Oh, that's right!"
112;416450;418330;"I'm going to ramble a bit."
113;418330;422440;"I believe part of a very strange species was 
brought to the Southern Piece auction..."
114;423380;426350;"There's suspicion that it's from 
an unidentified organism,"
115;426350;428430;"so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog,"
116;428430;432450;"but since they'd have to donate it 
to a government agency otherwise,"
117;432450;436530;"they hoped a licensed Hunter would 
buy it from them for a high price."
118;442480;444170;"Here you are."
119;452220;453660;"Well, Lin?"
120;453660;457100;"Th-This clearly belongs to an 
unidentified organism, yes."
121;457670;461600;"F-From what I can see, 
it resembles an insect's leg..."
122;461600;466090;"B-But no known insects have l-legs this large."
123;466920;470930;"And the claw exhibits traits 
not found among insects..."
124;472030;475310;"A leg typically has two claws, but this has six."
125;475310;479370;"It almost looks as though the tarsi 
evolved into something like fingers?"
126;479850;484880;"Yes, and this part is spiny, 
so it could be the tibia."
127;485280;489420;"If we take a sample and study 
it further, we'll learn more."
128;489800;492820;"Could you give us a small part?"
129;492820;496920;"Since Won-san referred you 
to us, we cannot refuse."
130;499940;502090;"Let's look into this, then."
131;502090;504770;"We'll send you any results, once we have them."
132;505870;506960;"Appreciated."
133;511860;513080;"Chimera Ant..."
134;518480;520790;"Where did Lin and Podungo go?"
135;521220;523630;"Somewhere south of Yorknew City."
136;524300;528410;"The person who found the insect leg 
apparently lives in a city by the ocean."
137;528790;532800;"Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath, 
but we should hurry after them."
138;533090;535830;"Hey, can we come with you?"
139;535830;536780;"Hmm?"
140;537670;538860;"Sure."
141;538860;540060;"Yes!"
142;540740;542390;"Glad to have you."
143;542390;546810;"Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring."
144;546810;550180;"And this is Ging-san's son and 
one of the Zoldyck family!"
145;550180;551730;"Oh, sorry..."
146;551730;553120;"It's no big deal."
147;556560;559970;"Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?"
148;559970;562580;"We weren't born with the talent..."
149;562580;566420;"Talent, talent... Guess I have a 
talent for saying "talent," huh?"
150;571040;573840;"In this brief period of time, 
they've become friends."
151;575930;578340;"Good Hunters are well-liked by animals."
152;579210;582350;"And also blessed with good friends."
153;586270;588290;"Gon might be the real deal..."
154;588960;591650;"He'll find you soon, Ging-san."
155;617860;620550;"Not enough... Not enough..."
156;620780;624260;"I need more, bigger food."
157;633460;635110;"It's been days..."
158;635110;638150;"No, it's been months since it last rained here."
159;638680;640810;"The weather is unusual this year."
160;641410;646290;"It's possible that this is affecting 
the wildlife in some way."
161;647080;649300;"So the insect with the large leg"
162;649300;652670;"could have been a mutation 
influenced by those conditions."
163;652670;654790;"But why would it have grown larger?"
164;654790;656790;"In order to survive, right?"
165;657350;660680;"If it's bigger, it'd have a better 
chance of securing food."
166;661070;664350;"But that would mean it'd need more, as well."
167;664350;668100;"Being larger doesn't always aid survival."
168;668610;670330;"I believe that this is"
169;670330;673310;"related to the Chimera Ant's unique 
nature, not to the environment."
170;673620;674770;"I agree."
171;674770;679570;"Because they reproduce in a way 
not found in any other organism."
172;679570;681110;"What do you mean?"
173;681110;684660;"They reproduce through a special 
process known as phagogenesis."
174;685020;686950;"Phagogenesis?"
175;686950;687660;"What's that?"
176;687660;690280;"{\fad(1,382)}Phagogenesis"
177;689070;692590;"When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms,"
178;692590;694340;"she is able to pass traits on"
179;694340;697250;"from those organisms to the next generation."
180;699380;703830;"And she can also eat multiple species"
181;703830;707170;"to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring."
182;709530;713250;"With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs."
183;713750;717830;"The first generation of births has 
no reproductive capability,"
184;717830;720300;"so they become worker or soldier ants."
185;720990;726220;"They work in service to the queen 
and her eventual successors."
186;727640;731790;"Those successors are the king and 
queen of the next generation."
187;731790;735880;"The queen is thus always looking to 
consume the genes of strong organisms,"
188;735880;739550;"so she can pass them to her offspring."
189;739870;744780;"And she may consume any species she 
particularly likes to extinction."
190;744780;746170;"To extinction?!"
191;746540;749050;"Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her"
192;749050;753270;"to consume her own weight many 
times over, in a single day."
193;753820;757770;"That's why Chimera Ants are 
under a class-1 quarantine."
194;758240;761280;"So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?"
195;762170;766140;"Judging from the size of that claw, 
her length is at least two meters."
196;766880;769660;"That thing could devour a human in no time."
197;774970;777170;"Yes, you are correct."
198;783840;786050;"Stay back! Go away!"
199;786050;787930;"B-Big Brother..."
200;788490;790520;"Reina, stay close to me."
201;800600;801670;"Take that!"
202;810700;812170;"It's okay now."
203;812170;814330;"Thank you!"
204;814330;816090;"You can count on your big brother."
205;816090;818620;"I'll always keep you safe!"
206;819420;820290;"Yeah!"
207;820930;822450;"Okay, let's go home."
208;827780;830340;"Hey, my brother was amazing!"
209;830340;832310;"There was a big snake, but he was like,"
210;832580;834730;""Stay back! Go away!""
211;834730;836060;"Whack!"
212;836320;839370;"Come now, don't wave your spoon around."
213;839810;841450;"It's bad manners."
214;841450;843500;"But that's what he did."
215;843500;845440;"Yes, yes. I know."
216;846700;847900;"That was very brave."
217;847900;853950;"If a big snake showed up, 
your mother might be too scared to move."
218;854400;856980;"You're truly a young man, Kurt."
219;858900;859960;"Yeah, I guess."
220;861500;863540;"You're already nine..."
221;864450;866170;"And a reliable big brother."
222;867100;870470;"You must continue to look after Reina."
223;871110;873400;"I'm counting on you, Kurt."
224;873700;876170;"I'm counting on you, Brother."
225;876170;877730;"Yeah, you can count on me!"
226;878420;882220;"I'll keep you both safe forever!"
227;892730;895740;"This area is about to hatch."
228;916270;918610;"Soldiers, hear me!"
229;918610;921520;"My duty is to give birth to the King."
230;922020;923940;"In order to give birth to a strong king,"
231;923940;928130;"I require large quantities of highly nutritious food."
232;928650;931270;"Search out the best food you can find!"
233;938540;940740;"This area will also hatch soon."
234;941710;945520;"I require a large nest in 
which to birth a strong king."
235;945520;950670;"I also need time to rest, free from concerns 
of outside disturbances, during the pregnancy."
236;953230;958040;"In order to give birth to a strong 
king, I need strong soldiers."
237;964390;965530;"Are you okay?"
238;965530;967490;"Uh-huh, thank you..."
239;970760;972450;"Hey, Brother..."
240;973250;977330;"When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you."
241;978690;979530;"Sure."
242;980750;983920;"Let's wake up early tomorrow 
and go fishing at the river."
243;984500;985200;"Yeah."
244;985800;989840;"We can cook some fish to surprise Mom."
245;990490;992510;"Uh-huh, I can't wait."
246;1003620;1007220;"This is enough fish for a feast."
247;1007220;1007860;"Yep."
248;1015960;1017820;"B-Big Brother..."
249;1022490;1023620;"Big Brother!"
250;1024150;1025900;"Reina, it's okay."
251;1028410;1029420;"I'll..."
252;1029860;1032770;"Your big brother will protect you!"
253;1034660;1036720;"I promised Mom!"
254;1037520;1039220;"I'll keep you safe!"
255;1041390;1042620;"Go away..."
256;1043350;1044480;"Go away!"
257;1052400;1054490;"This is delicious,"
258;1055930;1057640;"and very nutritious..."
259;1057640;1059490;"The ultimate food."
260;1060710;1063250;"I need more of this species."
261;1067180;1070440;"They're the ones I mentioned on 
the phone, Gon and Killua."
262;1070440;1073140;"Oh, I'm Lin Koshi."
263;1073140;1074340;"N-Nice to meet you."
264;1074790;1076870;"My name's Podungo Lapoy."
265;1076870;1078890;"Glad to have you on board."
266;1079330;1082760;"Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san."
267;1082760;1083550;"Hey."
268;1084230;1087020;"Let's get down to business.
Where was the leg discovered?"
269;1087690;1089810;"On the beach over there."
270;1089810;1092230;"A-According to the locals,"
271;1092230;1095280;"it washed up on sh-shore."
272;1104100;1106210;"There's a forest right behind us..."
273;1106920;1110670;"It'll be difficult to find the 
Chimera Ant if it ran in there."
274;1112790;1116070;"We can't be certain that it's still alive."
275;1116070;1121680;"We don't even know if it ended up 
on the same island its leg drifted to."
276;1122490;1123720;"Let's find out, then."
277;1127810;1129690;"Here, remember this scent."
278;1132040;1133190;"I'll help, too!"
279;1133570;1134390;"Huh?"
280;1136070;1138450;"His nose is as sharp as a dog's."
281;1157250;1159110;"He can't find anything..."
282;1159490;1161890;"The scent may have disappeared."
283;1161890;1163720;"It was raining."
284;1164170;1165880;"I couldn't find anything, either."
285;1165880;1167980;"That means the Chimera Ant isn't here."
286;1169290;1172920;"It may have washed ashore elsewhere."
287;1174040;1176230;"In which direction do the currents flow here?"
288;1176890;1178400;"It's complicated..."
289;1178400;1180840;"The direction is reversed
between day and night."
290;1181360;1183100;"And it also changes with the seasons."
291;1183100;1184990;"I've even heard it's different on certain days."
292;1186800;1189500;"So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location..."
293;1190060;1191950;"It's too early to give up."
294;1191950;1193540;"Let's split up and search."
295;1194070;1195000;"You're right."
296;1210630;1212130;"No luck..."
297;1212400;1215020;"Continuing to search blindly is pointless."
298;1215480;1217330;"Let's return to Yorknew City."
299;1217330;1221160;"We may be able to find a new lead."
300;1235500;1238360;"Her length is at least two meters."
301;1238800;1241800;"That thing could devour a human in no time."
302;1243210;1245650;"A voracious appetite..."
303;1245650;1247680;"Phagogenesis."
304;1266090;1266950;"Your Majesty..."
305;1267600;1270450;"Oh, you can speak?"
306;1271320;1273230;"So that I may fully receive,"
307;1273230;1276820;"understand, and execute your orders."
308;1277230;1278590;"That pleases me."
309;1279120;1282720;"I assign you to be a squadron leader."
310;1283370;1284940;"I am most grateful."
311;1285300;1286470;"I already have your mission."
312;1286710;1289810;"Lead all the soldiers here on a mission"
313;1290290;1291870;"to capture my food..."
314;1292820;1297280;"Capture more of those highly 
nutritious organisms for me."
315;1297600;1298440;"At once!"
316;1309210;1313500;"A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes."
317;1314340;1318680;"Kite's worst fears have been realized."
318;1407370;1410130;"Next time: Very x Rapid x Reproduction."
319;1410130;1412070;"My name is Gon Freecss."
320;1412070;1413760;"My name is Killua Zoldyck."
321;1414280;1415880;"What's your name?"
