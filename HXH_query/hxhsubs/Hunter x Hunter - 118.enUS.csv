4;9770;10750;"He..."
5;11930;13130;"He..."
6;14090;16470;"looked at me like I was trash!"
7;17470;21780;"Give that bastard an extra punch for me..."
8;25500;27750;"Yeah, I got it!"
9;29800;32320;"Sorry, master..."
10;33280;35260;"We're both fools."
11;37790;40790;"There's something more important 
than the world right now!"

13;130220;132330;"Though the central tower's third floor"
14;132330;138020;"escaped destruction, having been 
cushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail,"
15;138020;141740;"it had been blown slightly to 
the left of its original position,"
16;141740;147040;"barely keeping the building's appearance intact
while maintaining a precarious balance."

central tower's lower portion,"
18;152080;156730;"which had been reduced to rubble 
resembling an ancient gladiator arena..."
19;158960;161560;"I am a foolish servant of the King,"
20;162070;165930;"letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey."
21;166960;168670;"That's how I should approach it."
22;169130;170940;"That's the impression I should give them."
23;177120;180340;"Where are you hiding, little rats?"
24;181520;185270;"Come out here, so I can squash you!"
25;190940;193960;"I know he'll show himself again..."

29;203610;205260;"Shut up!"
30;207400;211270;"While Youpi was allowing a 
false rage to consume him,"

in order to draw out Knuckle..."
32;217970;222270;"No matter what happens outside, 
my goal is to pin this guy here."
33;224410;226740;"That's all I need to do!"
34;227700;230790;"Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms,"
35;230790;235520;"tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke,"
36;236240;242010;"maintained just enough distance 
as to go unnoticed by Morel"
37;243130;250470;"as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out 
his escape from Smoky Jail."
38;254830;256990;"Beneath the northern section of the palace"

40;256540;259300;"{\fad(500,1)\an6}Border Guard Area F"
41;257300;262260;"was a large area, with warehouses laid 
out in the shape of a dragonfly."

Emergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C"
44;262860;265660;"Area D, located on one of the wing's tips,"
45;265660;267950;"was where Bizeff had created a private zone"
46;267950;270790;"with his warehouse for hiding women."
47;271600;276310;"Having learned the warehouse's 
location from Marcos,"
48;276310;280750;"Ikalgo was making his way there by truck"
49;280750;282300;"via a direct, five-kilometer road."
50;283410;287060;"By the time Ikalgo had reached"
51;287060;290390;"the crossroads that led to Areas A and B,"
52;292200;295970;"his Satellite Dragonflies had already 
arrived at the warehouse."
53;298330;299630;"The door's open..."
54;299970;301320;"This is a good sign."
55;302690;305700;"Palm put Bizeff to sleep 
and headed for the palace."
56;306620;310500;"When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock 
the door in his rush to follow her."
57;311450;313250;"That's the likely explanation."
58;318870;321210;"Brovada's in the border guard area?"
59;324970;327220;"This meant that Ikalgo"
60;328970;333720;"had no choice but to face Brovada."
61;336370;338800;"Brovada doesn't trust me."
62;339640;342580;"Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?"
63;344020;345490;"Stay calm..."
64;346110;350120;"Stay calm and figure out what he 
knows and what he doesn't,"
65;352460;353820;"in order to stay alive!"
66;357320;361380;"What happened during our encounter 
that aroused his suspicion?"
67;362100;365130;"Was there something unnatural 
about my imitation of Flutter?"
68;367120;373350;"I suppose it would be strange for Hagya 
to order me to go underground."
69;374240;378750;"But since they didn't stop me on the spot,"
70;379320;381480;"my mistake must not have been fatal."
71;381900;386570;"Rather, something aroused an inkling 
of doubt in the back of Brovada's mind."
72;388460;393280;"And Brovada's down here because he 
wants to confirm those doubts!"
73;395640;397680;"Was it small enough that I can explain?"
74;398180;402280;"Or was it big enough that he 
only wants final verification?"
75;403870;405210;"No room for optimism."
76;406090;407800;"I should assume it was a big mistake."
77;408720;410020;"Is anyone here?"
78;410380;412680;"I am a messenger from the secretary!"
79;413660;415160;"Depending on the response..."
80;415160;417660;"No, I have to assume"
81;417660;419940;"that if he has a chance, he'll attack..."
82;420820;421890;"Or he'll kill me!"
83;424520;426750;"I am a messenger from the secretary!"
84;426750;428940;"The secretary ordered me to come here!"
85;429930;431460;"Thinker Bell!"
86;431460;434950;"If you're here, you must come with me at once!"
87;435780;440520;"Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse."
88;442630;447100;"This was meant to reassure 
Palm that he was an ally."
89;449240;451760;"Why didn't you respond?"
90;452480;453920;"Where's everyone else?"
91;453920;457970;"I d-don't know anything about 
what's happening outside..."
92;458720;463510;"I'm not allowed to talk to anyone 
other than the secretary."
93;464760;466470;"She had assumed"
94;466470;470610;"that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary."
95;471510;474370;"The other women thought the same thing."
96;475350;479240;"Each room had a phone exclusively 
for communication with Bizeff,"
97;479560;483870;"so it was illogical for him to send 
a messenger, hence their suspicion."
98;484480;488420;"They believed that a visit from a stranger"
99;488420;493180;"must be a test to see if they could 
stay calm and follow orders"
100;493180;495230;"under unusual circumstances,"
101;495230;498000;"so they refused to speak to Ikalgo."
102;498500;502020;"However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor."
103;503530;504570;"Is this the place?"
104;505460;511400;"The women had a much higher chance 
of surviving if they stayed here."
105;512060;518480;"Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about 
keeping them alive, much less protecting them."
106;520270;522090;"<i>There's writing in </i>Nen!"
107;523910;530420;"The characters, formed by aura, 
could only be seen when using <i>Gyo</i>."
108;531510;534570;"It was less likely that Bizeff"
109;534570;538110;"would find a message that wasn't 
on paper or some other device."
110;538730;539920;""Heading to the palace."
111;540810;543100;"If I don't make contact before the mission,"
112;544100;546440;"assume I am dead.""
113;548500;550440;"Ikalgo had expected this."
114;551230;557060;"But he still felt as much anguish as 
if he had lost part of his own body."
115;560120;561050;"Palm..."
116;563560;568710;"If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead,"
117;569250;573490;"use your Satellite Dragonflies and 
telepathy to support the team."
118;574460;575470;"Got it."
119;576110;578680;"Pretend that you're reporting 
to your Squadron Leader,"
120;578990;581470;"when you're actually reporting to Meleoron."
121;581800;585480;"So you want me to feed the enemy lies, 
to throw them off?"
122;585840;589980;"{\fad(1,1225)}Yes. It's a crucial task. 
I'm counting on you."
123;591270;594240;"That will only be possible"
124;594240;596880;"if they don't know Meleoron is here, 
or that I've switched sides."
125;597920;603230;"Which means that, since he 
is already suspicious of me,"
126;603230;604820;"I must eliminate Brovada!"
127;625170;628270;"Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?"
128;628610;630770;"Yeah... I did."
129;631900;633770;"Hagya, huh?"
130;635810;638400;"Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?"
131;669870;672600;"Okay, the fake is dead."
132;678100;679240;"Empty?"
133;681460;684870;"Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya."
134;700070;702380;"The suspect is now dead!"
135;703450;706910;"Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,"
136;707710;709360;"I can move around freely."
137;710670;714400;"Still, I never heard anything about 
Hagya changing his name!"
138;715370;716850;"What's he called now?"
139;718800;722010;"It's true that I really knew 
nothing of his new name..."
140;723530;727070;"But will they believe that?"
141;729890;734690;"I must think of a reason they'll accept 
if I encounter any of them."
142;736560;738420;"No, that won't work!"
143;739670;741630;"Brovada opened fire without warning!"
144;742460;747170;"That shows they think anyone who doesn't 
know Hagya's new name is an enemy."
145;748450;749770;"If they find me, there'll be a battle!"
146;750360;752510;"I have to go back up there expecting that!"
147;754310;756770;"Please enter your code number."
148;762430;764090;"The elevator isn't ascending!"
149;765410;769160;"Don't tell me that he came 
down here without knowing"
150;769160;770290;"about the passcode system."
151;772490;773430;"This is my chance!"
152;774080;775890;"I have two options to pick from!"
153;780440;782650;"Show yourself!"
154;785590;789220;"It's nearly been five minutes since 
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy activated."
155;790390;794060;"Which means the </i>Nen<i> I've 
loaned him is nearing 7,000."
156;794620;798790;"Is that enough to guarantee that he won't 
pay off the full balance with one hit?"
157;799800;800750;"I just..."
158;801220;802930;"I just have to avoid a direct hit."
159;804650;808640;"The worst possible scenario 
would be that I'm hit"
160;808640;812750;"by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7 
Bankruptcy, and also deals damage to me."
161;813440;815130;"If that's gonna happen,"
162;815130;819720;"I'm better off buying time, 
waiting for him to go bust."
163;821610;826110;"But that means I'll have to wait"
164;826110;828510;"for at least ten minutes."
165;829180;832510;"Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!"
166;833440;836910;"I have to make him explode once more."
167;837370;839900;"Or else we'll run out of time!"
168;840720;844940;"Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!"
169;848560;850530;"You look happy, monster!"
170;853200;858540;"He fell for my trap, for my false rage."
171;860530;863190;"I've been looking for you, cockroach."
172;863190;866550;"Make this damn fly that's 
following me around shut up!"
173;864540;866550;"Damn Fly"
174;867430;872490;"Every time it squeaks, 
I'm reminded of your annoying face!"
175;873540;877480;"Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time."
176;878890;882060;"But I'll be faking it..."
177;882690;883700;"It's time."
178;883700;885180;"Adding interest."
179;885180;887760;"Just shut up!"
180;888560;891550;"Right before I explode, I pause for a moment."
181;892200;894750;"He'll try to attack during that opening."
182;895380;902200;"But if I stay calm when my rage takes over, 
I can control my growth."
183;904560;907830;"Get this thing off me right now..."
184;908500;910090;"Or I'll kill you!"
185;910870;915950;"I'll blow every last one of you 
to smithereens, you scum!"
186;917700;922550;"When he tries to take advantage of 
the opening I give him, he'll be open."
187;923170;924550;"And I'll take advantage of that."
188;925830;927970;"That won't happen, you giant lump."
189;928590;932270;"You're gonna die on your knees right here."
190;934070;935120;"The next one..."
191;936720;939620;"The next tick of the interest will be the gong."
192;940950;945260;"I'll show you who the cockroach is here."
193;961650;962900;"It's time."
194;963820;965540;"Adding interest."
195;976310;977260;"This will work."
196;977260;980910;"I have time to land one... No, two hits!"
197;981590;987310;"I have time to punch him in the face, 
and get out of the way before the explosion!"
198;989120;991820;"Take this, pig!"
199;991820;993930;"This one's for Shoot!"
200;995400;997840;"And the next one's also for Shoot!"
201;1000240;1003260;"Is something wrong with me?"
202;1003570;1006740;"I was never that close to him..."
203;1007240;1011230;"Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him."
204;1012940;1016920;"I don't even know when he 
climbed to the rank of "friend"..."
205;1016920;1021540;"So why am I this desperate to avenge him?"
206;1022900;1026060;"It's not even "vengeance," since he's not dead..."
207;1026640;1030830;"Well, I guess a lot of it is that 
we've faced death together..."
208;1030830;1036050;"Anyone who's risked their 
life with you is a friend."
209;1036700;1043310;"But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!"
210;1043780;1048690;"He ignored someone who entered 
a fight with him expecting to die?"
211;1049470;1051800;"Has he no sympathy as a warrior?"
212;1051800;1054170;"Damn Ant!"
213;1055350;1059230;"I'm getting more and more pissed off!"
214;1059230;1062700;"I'll give him a third punch for myself!"
215;1063860;1066570;"Wow... I'm amazing myself!"
216;1066570;1069920;"I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!"
217;1070540;1072710;"And I haven't finished throwing my punch?"
218;1073570;1074980;"Wait..."
219;1075700;1077350;"Is this what they mean?"
220;1078420;1080170;"Time's almost frozen."
221;1081000;1084290;"Everything slows down..."
222;1086160;1088220;"right before you die?"
223;1099150;1102240;"He stopped the explosion!"
224;1105690;1107260;"He got me!"
225;1107900;1110750;"He was actually keeping his cool..."
226;1112510;1115130;"I can't stop!"
227;1115620;1117620;"Sorry, Shoot..."
228;1117620;1118760;"I screwed up!"
229;1121940;1125560;"The interest won't be enough to pay for this."
230;1128740;1130620;"It's over..."
231;1135970;1137100;"Shoot..."
232;1137700;1138680;"Boss..."
233;1139630;1140810;"Everyone..."
234;1141650;1142930;"Everything is..."
235;1144010;1145080;"up to you."
236;1160770;1161800;"Thunderbolt!"
237;1173620;1175060;"Lightning?"
238;1175060;1176940;"He's completely paralyzed..."
239;1177570;1178690;"This is my chance!"
240;1183760;1189460;"If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!"
241;1206470;1208560;"I did it! I did it! I did it!"
242;1208560;1210020;"I'm done! I can't do any more!"
243;1210020;1212980;"Crap, I almost died!"
244;1212980;1215340;"I could see the pearly gates..."
245;1215340;1218520;"My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital."
246;1220830;1224140;"I hit him eight times!"
247;1233180;1235500;"What just happened?"
248;1236650;1238630;"I'm sure he fell for my trap."
249;1239650;1241260;"What happened?"
250;1242130;1243510;"That's obvious."
251;1244260;1248360;"I didn't notice there was an attack 
coming from a different direction..."
252;1249310;1250740;"Is that possible?"
253;1251180;1256660;"That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive"
254;1256660;1258770;"until it was right over me?"
255;1259390;1261030;"The same thing happened before."
256;1261360;1265150;"Before I even realized it, 
this little nuisance was on me."
257;1265720;1267740;"There were no signs at all."
258;1285420;1290430;"I saw him back at the staircase..."
259;1292920;1294690;"Did he do it?"
260;1301750;1305380;"Sorry, but what's about to happen is"
