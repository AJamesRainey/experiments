2;3820;4730;"Huh?"
3;4730;7980;"That is the name the Queen gave me."
4;8480;11650;"From now on, call me Neferpitou."
5;91980;96990;"Light x And x Darkness"
6;100870;103700;"Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains..."
7;103700;106580;"Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains."
8;107000;110910;"Commander Neferpitou will hold"
9;110910;114510;"an award ceremony in auditorium one."
10;117940;121450;"If you are able to endure considerable pain,"
11;121450;124260;"you will receive tremendous power in return."
12;124260;128620;"That power is to be used for our Queen!"
13;139550;141780;"They're continuing to go straight."
14;142510;146790;"The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead."
15;147510;148930;"Amazing..."
16;149400;152870;"He's been picking them up this entire time, 
never losing them for an instant."
17;152870;156920;"Kite said he could use <i>En</i> within 
a radius of forty-five meters."
18;157340;161950;"I've heard that those called <i>Nen</i> masters 
can handle around fifty meters."
19;162570;164730;"Kite is nearly there."
20;165250;168300;"Actually, given that he's kept 
it up for an entire night,"
21;168300;169670;"he's probably stronger."
22;172230;174190;"Stronger than a master..."
23;177620;180230;"Then Kite's the real deal."
24;180230;184700;"Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met."
25;185890;187950;"Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter,"
26;188410;193110;"but we really only knew him 
as another player in a game."
27;194440;196460;"Bisky was an incredible Hunter."
28;196830;198420;"But to us..."
29;198420;199920;"Yeah, she was our <i>Nen</i> mentor."
30;201750;204220;"And the first to teach us about <i>Nen</i>..."
31;204900;207100;"Wing-san was our <i>Nen</i> master and savior."
32;209990;211910;"Looking back,"
33;211910;215240;"we always meet the right people 
just when we need them most."
34;216030;220740;"And those people have all made us stronger."
35;221360;223220;"Razor, too, huh?"
36;223220;223990;"Yeah."
37;225140;230370;"It's clear that Ging really did create 
<i>Greed Island </i>to train you."
38;230840;234630;"And once you beat the game, 
he deliberately led you to Kite."
39;235230;236250;"Ging!"
40;249600;254400;"I'm not sure if Ging predicted what 
would happen when we met Kite."
41;258020;259900;"But he certainly knew"
42;260230;263830;"that you would like the man who 
had earned Ging's respect."
43;265470;269220;"And he knew without doubt 
that you would go with Kite."
44;269660;273920;"He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite."
45;274790;278420;"This is a pretty brutal place for training, though."
46;278950;283550;"That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm."
47;287390;289560;"As you mentioned,"
48;290800;296060;"Ging-san probably had certain 
expectations when he sent you to me."
49;296840;301510;"But I do not intend to train 
you during this journey."
50;301940;303940;"We don't have that kind of time."
51;306460;310320;"I brought you along because I 
thought you might be of use."
52;310870;313940;"From here, it all comes down to your resolve."
53;314610;318990;"If it's strong, you'll develop your <i>Nen</i> 
and grow strong via combat."
54;319710;323170;"If it's weak, the Ants will eat you."
55;324990;327150;"But we can't die..."
56;328110;330680;"We are pro Hunters."
57;330960;335430;"Those who call themselves 
Hunters always get their prey."
58;337420;342920;"For Hunters, that is the first commandment."
59;339270;344320;"{\fad(528,1)}Those who call themselves Hunters 
should always be on the hunt."
60;345040;348570;"A hunt involves both hunter and prey."
61;348570;351080;"It is a battle of resolve."
62;351960;356780;"Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve 
is what makes a successful hunt."
63;357760;361040;"The loser has to follow the 
winner's rules and customs."
64;361040;363340;"Usually, this means the loser's death."
65;364270;365340;"Rules..."
66;366030;368410;"If you don't want that result, then win."
67;368830;370740;"Improving your <i>Nen</i> is important, of course."
68;371250;377030;"But to be a successful Hunter, you must 
understand your enemy and yourself."
69;378110;379780;"Th-That's why..."
70;379780;383150;"That's why you hit me back then!"
71;389340;390320;"Fool!"
72;390610;394030;"Why would you try to enter Snake 
Beech Forest in this season?!"
73;395330;396340;"Look!"
74;396340;399930;"That's a territorial marker 
made by Foxbears with cubs."
75;399930;405090;"Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!"
76;407920;410970;"That was the forest's rule and custom."
77;413580;416810;"You taught me the rules in Ging's place."
78;424320;425360;"Oh..."
79;426830;429470;"That's right... I just remembered."
80;434090;435830;"A Hunter License?"
81;436130;437120;"What's this?"
82;437610;438870;"This is Ging-san's."
83;438870;441120;"Huh? It's Ging's?"
84;441670;445250;"Do you remember what my final test was?"
85;446020;449380;"Yeah, to find Ging."
86;449750;453490;"Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me."
87;454350;458060;"He said I should use it to find him..."
88;460590;464110;"I planned to return it to him once I did."
89;464630;466900;"Huh? He wouldn't take it back?"
90;467230;468190;"No..."
91;468740;471040;"I completely forgot I had it."
92;472620;477280;"Gon, you said that you're going to 
find Ging-san on your own, right?"
93;477280;478190;"Huh?"
94;479080;480040;"Yeah."
95;480410;482630;"Then you have to do it."
96;482900;486510;"And would you return this for me?"
97;486510;487440;"Sure!"
98;487920;493550;"But first, I have to finish this job 
with you and get a lot stronger."
99;494220;498060;"After that, I'll find Ging and give this back."
100;498810;500140;"I promise!"
101;501660;503040;"I'm counting on you."
102;504710;505560;"Well,"
103;505860;509400;"let's get a move on before we lose the trail."
104;514980;516460;"Take that!"
105;518590;519830;"Next!"
106;521070;523490;"Being average is terrible..."
107;523490;527370;"You have to go to all this trouble 
just to unleash your power."
108;533580;535830;"Peggy, I'll leave this to you."
109;535830;536970;"Where are you going?"
110;538050;542500;"I want to find out how strong I really am."
111;547450;548700;"That's a monster."
112;550320;552100;"What is this?"
113;552100;553500;"I don't believe it!"
114;553500;555260;"What's wrong, Kite?"
115;555260;556430;"Gon, Killua..."
116;556430;557330;"Run!"
117;557330;557990;"Huh?"
118;558390;559700;"Hurry up!"
119;559700;561030;"Get out of here!"
120;570760;572760;"Found you..."
121;577570;579220;"Get away from me!"
122;603180;605180;"{\fad(126,1)}Malice"
123;619850;620470;"Idio—"
124;626080;627890;"Good decision, Killua."
125;629200;631400;"Take Gon and run!"
126;648820;650920;"This time, you're in big trouble..."
127;651120;653030;"Let's see if you get a good roll!"
128;654800;655910;"3!"
129;655910;658920;"Ah, so you can do stuff like that?"
130;682950;685530;"We were overconfident..."
131;695950;699010;"The two of us were still weaker 
than Kite who'd lost an arm."
132;700180;701890;"That thing knew."
133;703580;705100;"This is reality."
134;706750;707970;"If Kite had been alone,"
135;708750;710680;"this probably wouldn't have happened."
136;713810;716730;"We were fools!"
137;734350;735290;"Hey..."
138;742180;743220;"Look."
139;783890;786340;"Huh? You left Kite behind?"
140;786340;787760;"Why?!"
141;788010;789540;"What happened?"
142;789540;791270;"Explain what's going on!"
143;791270;794020;"H-Hey, what are you doing?!"
144;795450;797480;"Yes, I understand."
145;797480;799520;"Can you wait there a little longer?"
146;799860;803030;"We're headed your way right now."
147;804050;806230;"We have reinforcements."
148;850840;852260;"Chairman Netero."
149;853200;855500;"What's this? They're just kids."
150;856500;860350;"If you're here to play, you'll get burned."
151;860350;862590;"Go back home."
152;865570;867590;"Stop it, Morel-san."
153;868800;870470;"That isn't nice..."
154;872840;875720;"They're only children."
155;880880;883510;"You look pretty defeated."
156;885510;888240;"Was the enemy that strong?"
157;896340;898410;"One of them could use <i>Nen</i>."
158;899800;904470;"That was the worst aura I've ever encountered."
159;906290;907350;"Worse than my brother's..."
160;909930;911000;"Worse than Hisoka's..."
161;916060;918860;"Now that I've learned <i>Nen</i> myself, I can tell."
162;920930;923740;"You guys are unbelievably strong."
163;926140;930010;"But I still can't see you defeating that thing..."
164;937090;940010;"Whenever humans encounter the unknown,"
165;940010;942490;"they tend to lose perspective."
166;943830;947920;"Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic."
167;948620;953430;"We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed."
168;955810;959430;"You're no better than I am, Knov."
169;962930;964090;"Kid..."
170;964090;970460;"The minute you start talking about who 
can win in a <i>Nen</i> fight, you're wrong."
171;971200;974690;"In most cases, you won't know 
your opponent's abilities."
172;976260;979070;"One instant of carelessness"
173;979950;983090;"is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life."
174;984350;990000;"You can't make assumptions based 
on the amount of aura displayed."
175;990680;993970;"The battle can turn at any point."
176;994460;996470;"That's what fighting with <i>Nen</i> means."
177;997500;999680;"But regardless,"
178;1000460;1003150;"you must always fight certain of victory."
179;1004260;1007170;"That is a <i>Nen</i> user's spirit."
180;1008340;1010570;"The moment you were overwhelmed"
181;1010570;1012790;"by the opponent's aura and fled, 
you were disqualified."
182;1013450;1014890;"You're lower than a loser!"
183;1014890;1016990;"Morel, that's enough."
184;1018210;1021000;"Is Gon asleep?"
185;1021930;1024810;"He was going to attack the enemy,"
186;1024810;1026500;"so I used force to stop him."
187;1027840;1029850;"I didn't have time to control my strength,"
188;1030370;1032010;"so I don't know when he'll wake up."
189;1033820;1036500;"That kid shows some promise, then."
190;1036500;1037760;"Morel!"
191;1038680;1043450;"It's difficult to believe that giant 
Chimera Ants are eating humans,"
192;1044050;1046310;"but since it appears to be true,"
193;1046310;1049900;"we must keep casualties to a minimum."
194;1050360;1055270;"If we send fighters who aren't strong enough, 
they'll only strengthen the enemy."
195;1056140;1057410;"Do you understand?"
196;1058160;1059150;"Yeah."
197;1065030;1066900;"That's why there are only three."
198;1067770;1069280;"A select few..."
199;1071150;1072510;"We're not"
200;1073710;1075200;"strong enough."
201;1082310;1086030;"We sent two assassins to the nearest village."
202;1089780;1092440;"It's your decision whether you want to fight."
203;1092870;1096350;"But you must defeat them before you come."
204;1099310;1101790;"If you wish to live as a Hunter..."
205;1104520;1106710;"We are not desperate for help."
206;1108010;1110560;"We only seek the strong."
207;1124080;1127480;"{\fad(419,1)}Will you fight!? Or not!?"
208;1152650;1155170;"The moment you were overwhelmed"
209;1155170;1157510;"by the opponent's aura and fled, 
you were disqualified."
210;1158590;1160100;"You're lower than a loser!"
211;1161870;1164580;"I am no longer qualified..."
212;1166560;1167590;"Killua..."
213;1170340;1171470;"Thanks."
214;1178600;1181520;"Why would you thank me?"
215;1182460;1186060;"Weren't you the one who stopped me?"
216;1187710;1192040;"Had I lost control back there, 
I would've gotten in Kite's way."
217;1194250;1198050;"Then, all three of us could have died."
218;1198380;1200550;"But I..."
219;1201560;1203550;"I let Kite die..."
220;1203730;1205180;"Kite is alive!"
221;1206600;1210560;"He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!"
222;1212130;1218470;"But considering his injury, 
he'd have a hard time moving around."
223;1218470;1220580;"So he's probably hiding."
224;1222460;1224570;"Waiting for us to return!"
225;1228530;1230820;"So we should hurry back..."
226;1230820;1232020;"Once we're stronger."
227;1235260;1237000;"To save Kite!"
228;1242560;1243350;"Gon..."
229;1248420;1251290;"You are light."
230;1257490;1259780;"Yeah, you're right."
231;1262020;1265160;"Sometimes, you shine so 
brightly, I must look away."
232;1267820;1271860;"But even so, is it still okay 
if I stay at your side?"
233;1276420;1277310;"Let's go."
234;1279840;1281110;"To become stronger!"
235;1288780;1292220;"{\fad(425,1)}We welcome you anytime!!"
236;1296870;1298980;"Prepare a freezer in the castle."
237;1300230;1303800;"We need one that can store 
over a hundred humans."
238;1306130;1308830;"To ensure that our collection doesn't rot."
239;1311030;1311890;"Yep."
240;1313570;1314730;"I think"
241;1315780;1317730;"I'm pretty strong."
242;1405030;1407260;"Next time: Promise x and x Reunion."
243;1408910;1411590;"It has to be Killua..."
