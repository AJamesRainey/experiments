5;23150;27080;"And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic."

8;115880;117050;"Gon-kun!"
9;117050;118300;"Where is everyone?"
10;119050;122010;"You need more rest, Gon-kun..."
11;126640;131650;"Some x Brother x Trouble"
12;134710;137650;"After Gon learned why Killua 
had been disqualified,"
13;138140;141660;"he was furious with Gittarackur..."
14;141660;144510;"Rather, Killua's brother, Illumi."
15;167170;168810;"Apologize to Killua!"
16;173150;175550;"Apologize? For what?"
17;176330;178310;"You don't know what you did wrong?"
18;178310;179450;"Nope."
19;181850;184370;"You don't have the right to be his brother."
20;185920;188700;"Must I earn the right to be his brother?"
21;199640;202710;"He doesn't need to earn the 
right to be my friend!"
22;210840;212350;"This boy is..."
23;215390;217370;"Don't bother apologizing."
24;217370;219860;"Just take me to see Killua."
25;220350;221810;"What will you do then?"
26;222320;223460;"That should be obvious..."
27;224450;226060;"I'm gonna rescue Killua!"
28;227270;230990;"You make it sound as 
though I kidnapped him..."
29;231620;235200;"He walked away on his own."
30;235980;238270;"But it wasn't by choice."
31;238710;241010;"He was being manipulated by you people."
32;241010;242990;"It's the same thing as kidnapping him!"
33;252540;256520;"We happened to be discussing 
this very subject, Gon."
34;256890;261030;"Kurapika and Leorio have both 
lodged complaints."
35;261470;264090;"The committee has been discussing"
36;264090;265870;"the fairness of Killua's disqualification."
37;265870;267290;"Killua had been behaving"
38;267290;270420;"in a strange manner during and 
since his battle with the man"
39;270420;272040;"who called himself Gittarackur!"
40;272290;278040;"I believe that he was hypnotized 
into committing murder."
41;278830;279880;"Under normal circumstances,"
42;279880;283800;"it would be impossible to use 
hypnosis to induce a person to kill."
43;283800;287240;"However, as Killua was raised 
in a family of assassins,"
44;287240;289170;"murder was a part of his daily life,"
45;289170;292310;"so it's natural that he would lack 
the ethical restraint of most!"
46;293250;294790;"I want to mention"
47;294790;298060;"that the attack happened during the 
match between Bodoro and me."
48;298840;303180;"It's possible that he was trying to help me."
49;304220;307530;"Given that, the one who should be disqualified"
50;308170;309780;"is me."
51;310380;311850;"In any case,"
52;311850;315790;"Killua was not in control of his own actions."
53;316320;319040;"Thus, he should not have been disqualified!"
54;320110;322930;"That is mere speculation."
55;322930;324800;"There is no proof."
56;325500;330280;"There were no clear signs of manipulation."
57;330280;332310;"In fact, I would question"
58;332310;336060;"the claim that he was hypnotized."
59;336640;339400;"I agree that the incident occurred after"
60;339400;343190;"the battle between Leorio 
and Bodoro had begun."
61;343520;347980;"At that point, both fighters 
were evenly matched."
62;347980;351280;"Bodoro had more experience."
63;351280;356960;"But in terms of raw combat ability, 
Leorio was the stronger."
64;357620;361890;"There was no need for Killua to interfere."
65;362960;365560;"There was some other funny 
business happening."
66;366980;369840;"Like when you fought Hisoka."
67;370570;371470;"Back then,"
68;372630;374470;"what did he say to you?"
69;375510;377480;"Neither of you seemed particularly tired."
70;378560;380930;"But Hisoka whispered something in your ear,"
71;380930;382230;"right before conceding."
72;383910;385230;"That's pretty strange."
73;385640;388930;"I'd understand surrendering after your 
opponent whispers something to you,"
74;388930;391700;"as happened with Hanzo and me, 
or Bodoro and Hisoka."
75;392100;394740;"Because we were under 
considerable pressure."
76;395660;397560;"But in your case, the exact opposite happened."
77;397910;401520;"I have to wonder if you struck 
some sort of bargain."
78;402840;406210;"If you're going to question 
anything that seems odd,"
79;406210;409010;"your own victory was quite odd, indeed."
80;410040;414010;"If you have nothing to hide, 
you should tell us what he said."
81;414610;416270;"Right now."
82;416790;418660;"I have no obligation to tell you."
83;419930;422610;"Maybe not, but I believe you owe it to us."
84;423390;424220;"Not really."
85;425070;427400;"If you consider my victory to be odd,"
86;427400;430960;"a victory by default would be equally odd."
87;431910;433410;"What?!"
88;437680;439580;"None of that matters..."
89;440660;441790;"Come on..."
90;442320;445790;"I want to get this lecture 
over with so I can leave."
91;448820;449920;"Hey, now..."
92;450150;452680;"None of that matters!"
93;456650;459560;"It's pointless to argue over whether 
someone should have passed."
94;460100;462100;"If you aren't happy about passing,"
95;462100;464810;"keep working until you're satisfied."
96;464810;469320;"If Killua retakes the Hunter Exam, 
he'll definitely pass!"
97;470150;473660;"It's unfortunate that he failed this time, 
but it is what it is."
98;475110;476330;"What does matter..."
99;476830;481580;"If you've been forcing Killua to kill, 
against his will, all this time,"
100;483070;485040;"I'll make you pay!"
101;486970;488490;"Make me pay?"
102;489010;491150;"What, exactly, will you do?"
103;491690;493030;"I won't do anything."
104;493490;497510;"Only, once I rescue Killua, 
I'll never let you see him again!"
105;513030;514110;"Ahem."
106;514530;517620;"Is everyone finished?"
107;518030;519950;"Gon is absolutely correct."
108;519950;524120;"You must decide for yourselves 
if you were worthy of passing."
109;524700;528370;"You may complain about 
the results all you like,"
110;528370;530880;"but we will not be changing our minds."
111;531720;534130;"Killua has been disqualified."
112;534680;538140;"And the rest of you have passed the exam."
113;545560;549150;"Okay, then I shall continue the orientation."
114;550850;554650;"The cards I've passed out 
are your Hunter Licenses."
115;556160;557480;"This card allows you"
116;557480;561530;"to enter 90% of the countries 
that limit immigration,"
117;561530;566670;"as well as 75% of the restricted 
areas in the world."
118;567040;568420;"Crazy..."
119;569680;574130;"This card also provides free access 
to 95% of public facilities,"
120;574130;577530;"and a line of credit that rivals 
large corporations."
121;579930;582930;"If you sell the card, you'll have enough 
money to last seven lifetimes."
122;582930;586230;"And if you keep it, you'll still 
be living in comfort."
123;588980;593440;"So take extra care that your 
license isn't lost or stolen."
124;593930;595610;"You won't receive a replacement."
125;597090;600470;"According to our estimates, 
one in five Hunters"
126;600470;605060;"lose their card within a year of receiving it."
127;606260;611090;"As a Hunter, your first challenge 
is to protect your card."
128;612450;614090;"The rest is up to you."
129;614560;617090;"Rise above challenges, 
believe in your own strength,"
130;617090;619360;"and fulfill your dreams."
131;620860;621600;"Then,"
132;622020;627600;"we now declare the seven members 
here to be new Hunters!"
133;633110;643200;"Hunter Vocabulary"
134;639150;643200;"License"
135;648720;649970;"Gittarackur..."
136;658970;661470;"Tell me where Killua is."
137;662000;663990;"Are you really going to take him away?"
138;664630;666480;"I think that's a bad idea."
139;666480;668230;"I don't care what you think!"
140;669130;671090;"Killua is my friend."
141;671090;672730;"I'm taking him with me."
142;673970;675840;"Do they feel the same way?"
143;677250;678500;"You bet."
144;684300;685240;"Fine."
145;685690;688540;"I doubt you'll be able to 
make it there anyway."
146;689110;691500;"Killua went home."
147;691500;692500;"Home?"
148;693930;695640;"Kukuroo Mountain."
149;696070;699510;"Our family lives at the very top."
150;699910;701670;"Kukuroo Mountain?"
151;701670;703500;"Got it. Thanks."
152;707040;708750;"Is it really okay"
153;708750;711770;"for an assassin to give away 
his base of operations?"
154;712490;715330;"Sure, it isn't a secret or anything."
155;715330;717270;"The locals all know where we live."
156;717840;720750;"Well, I'm sure they'll see the 
light once they arrive."
157;720750;724010;"We live in completely different worlds..."
158;725570;727280;"Oh, this?"
159;727870;730040;"Yep, it's broken."
160;734990;736970;"He has incredible potential."
161;737370;740550;"I can understand why you want 
to see him grow up."
162;742870;744300;"Didn't I tell you?"
163;745640;750240;"<i>But that makes him all the more dangerous.</i>"
164;751450;753750;"<i>This would be the best chance to...</i>"
165;758050;760640;"Gon is my prey."
166;760640;763860;"Touch him, and you'll suffer 
the consequences."
167;764610;766240;"I know."
168;766240;769490;"I've only known you for a short while, 
but I know your tastes."
169;770480;772300;"So, Hisoka."
170;773260;775250;"What are you going to do now?"
171;776270;778490;"Wait patiently."
172;783400;786820;"For the fruit to ripen..."
173;789180;791400;"Kukuroo Mountain?"
174;791400;792770;"Never heard of it before."
175;793050;795340;"Kurapika, do you know where it is?"
176;795920;797360;"Hey, Kurapika!"
177;797360;798270;"Huh?"
178;798760;801040;"Oh, what is it?"
179;801040;802390;"The mountain!"
180;802390;804920;"He said something about Kukuroo Mountain."
181;804920;806780;"Do you know where it might be?"
182;806780;809270;"No, I don't..."
183;809270;811310;"We can look it up online."
184;813660;814530;"Yo!"
185;815450;817540;"Oh, Hanzo-san!"
186;818530;820220;"I'm going back to my country."
187;820220;823430;"It was a short, yet seemingly long 
acquaintance, but I had fun."
188;823430;824800;"So did I."
189;825180;828290;"If you ever visit my country, let me know."
190;828290;831320;"I can show you the best tourist spots!"
191;832950;833980;"See ya!"
192;834730;835950;"Bye!"
193;838810;840810;"Cloud-Hidden Ninja 
Hanzo"
194;841380;844500;"A shinobi who tries to leave an impression..."
195;844500;845170;"Hey."
196;848590;851700;"Sorry about getting so excited back there."
197;852160;854520;"No, I also lost control."
198;854520;855810;"Forgive me."
199;856640;860580;"No, I only got mad because you were right."
200;861560;865590;"I was using you to take out my 
frustration for winning by default."
201;866040;867730;"But I'm over that now."
202;867730;870340;"Since I passed, I'm going to make the best of it!"
203;871460;874570;"The question is what to do next."
204;874570;876350;"Yes, you're right."
205;876870;880580;"I'm going to travel the world, 
gathering information"
206;880580;884860;"and discovering new species, 
as an Exotic Game Hunter."
207;885150;886960;"An Exotic Game Hunter..."
208;886960;888980;"Hey, what's that?"
209;888980;890080;"Oh, this?"
210;890530;893120;"You can use this to obtain 
all kinds of information."
211;893570;895400;"Is there anything you'd like to know?"
212;895400;897040;"I can look it up on the spot."
213;897040;898120;"Oh..."
214;898680;901780;"Can you look up a Hunter named Ging?"
215;901780;903630;"Ging Freecss."
216;904270;906630;"Sure, hold on..."
217;913170;914370;"Satotz?"
218;915710;919420;"Hey, who is this Ging guy?"
219;919420;920140;"Huh?"
220;920490;922550;"All information related to him is behind"
221;922550;924400;"a tight security system that"
222;924400;926900;"requires a bunch of different accesses."
223;927290;930550;"He has some serious influence, 
even at the national level."
224;930550;932400;"Huh? Really?"
225;932400;933910;"Forget it, then..."
226;934670;938820;"Looks like your dad is someone really special."
227;940610;944060;"Okay, let me know if anything comes up."
228;944060;945660;"This is my e-mail address."
229;946410;947360;"Bye."
230;948300;949450;"Bye!"
231;952910;956090;"We should have asked him to 
look up Kukuroo Mountain."
232;956090;957310;"That's right."
233;957570;958540;"It's okay."
234;958540;962620;"As Chairman Netero was saying, 
we are all Hunters now."
235;962620;966730;"It's a bad idea to let other Hunters 
know what you're doing."
236;966730;968670;"We can look it up ourselves."
237;969730;970820;"Gon-kun."
238;974880;976130;"Satotz-san!"
239;979070;981230;"Gon-kun, you forgot this."
240;981750;983070;"Oh, right..."
241;983070;984130;"Thanks!"
242;984860;986960;"And do you have a moment?"
243;989070;991060;"We'll be waiting in the lobby."
244;991060;991820;"Okay!"
245;998150;1002140;"Forgive me, but I couldn't help but 
overhear your conversation."
246;1002520;1006460;"I happen to specialize in the 
discovery, restoration,"
247;1006460;1008470;"and preservation of ancient ruins."
248;1008470;1009790;"When I first began,"
249;1009790;1012480;"I was only focused on the glory 
derived from new discoveries."
250;1013540;1015660;"But after watching a certain Hunter at work,"
251;1015660;1018030;"I came to feel ashamed."
252;1023330;1025980;"That Hunter would discover ruins,"
253;1026420;1030120;"spend his own money to 
completely restore them,"
254;1030600;1034020;"and take steps to preserve the 
ruins for future generations,"
255;1034610;1038860;"thus ensuring that ordinary people 
would have a chance to see them."
256;1040220;1042630;"I was more impressed by 
his dedication to his job"
257;1042630;1045540;"than by the beauty of the ruins."
258;1046970;1049840;"The work he did to preserve those ruins"
259;1049840;1054150;"has been documented in manuals 
used around the world."
260;1054830;1057660;"And this Hunter, Gon-kun,"
261;1058430;1062820;"was Ging Freecss, the man 
you were asking about."
262;1067670;1070320;"I wished to meet him,"
263;1070320;1072920;"so I did some investigating."
264;1073480;1076700;"However, quite frankly, he is an enigma."
265;1076700;1079930;"I wasn't able to learn anything about him..."
266;1079930;1082280;"Really? Figures."
267;1083830;1086940;"My goal is to become a Hunter like him."
268;1087700;1091410;"My dream is to thank him in person one day."
269;1092950;1093770;"Uh-huh."
270;1096170;1097790;"That's all I had to say."
271;1098740;1101030;"Sorry for interrupting you."
272;1101410;1104420;"It's okay. Thanks for everything, Satotz-san."
273;1104420;1105160;"Bye!"
274;1105160;1105700;"Oh..."
275;1105700;1107110;"Gon-kun."
276;1108480;1109710;"Hmm?"
277;1111230;1112890;"Oh, never mind..."
278;1113370;1115210;"Take care of yourself."
279;1116290;1118350;"Yeah. You, too."
280;1118970;1119720;"Bye!"
281;1128700;1131310;"First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain."
282;1131310;1132020;"Yeah."
283;1132980;1135280;"Kukuroo Mountain..."
284;1135810;1136990;"There it is."
285;1137810;1139530;""Kukuroo Mountain."
286;1139530;1142370;"A 3,722 meter-high mountain,"
287;1142370;1144990;"in the Dentora region of 
the Republic of Padokea.""
288;1145520;1147330;"The Republic of Padokea?"
289;1147330;1148740;"Never heard of it."
290;1148740;1150020;"Where is it?"
291;1150020;1151250;"Hold on."
292;1151250;1152760;"I'll bring up a map."
293;1155140;1157010;"This is the Republic of Padokea."
294;1157790;1160440;"It should be fine. 
It appears to be a stable country."
295;1160440;1163010;"It allows ordinary tourists."
296;1163560;1165330;"That's where we'll find Killua?"
297;1165330;1168230;"By airship, it will take three days to reach..."
298;1168230;1169690;"When do we leave?"
299;1169690;1170980;"Today! Right now!"
300;1170980;1172980;"Yeah, no objection from me!"
301;1172980;1175970;"Understood. Then, I'll order tickets."
302;1183860;1184950;"What's going on?"
303;1185660;1187760;"We've been stuck in one place forever."
304;1187760;1189100;"This won't do."
305;1189100;1191620;"We'll be late for our flight."
306;1192820;1195020;"Pops! Do something!"
307;1195020;1197100;"I'm afraid I can't help this traffic."
308;1197100;1198800;"And this is the only road."
309;1198800;1199720;"In that case..."
310;1209050;1211580;"Yahoo!"
311;1218840;1220110;"Hey, Gon!"
312;1220110;1222610;"Do you realize how far away the airport is?"
313;1223220;1227700;"I want to rescue Killua as soon 
as humanly possible!"
314;1231040;1232920;"Fine, you win."
315;1235690;1239130;"This reminds me of the Hunter Exam."
316;1239130;1239880;"That's right."
317;1242650;1245800;"This is nothing compared 
to the Hunter Exam."
318;1246890;1248390;"Yeah..."
319;1249800;1250980;"You got that right."
320;1255590;1256790;"Okay..."
321;1256790;1258570;"Race you to the airport!"
322;1260820;1262150;"Ready..."
323;1262640;1263880;"Go!"
324;1265330;1269460;"Gon and his friends set off for 
the Republic of Padokea."
325;1269460;1273890;"Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain, 
where Killua's home is located."
326;1284770;1286140;"Satotz."
327;1286750;1288490;"Menchi. Buhara."
328;1289780;1291360;"Hey, Satotz..."
329;1291360;1293160;"That was a close call."
330;1294510;1296070;"You were watching?"
331;1297460;1299500;"That boy is a mystery..."
332;1299500;1301440;"I find myself wanting to help him."
333;1304440;1306660;"I almost let the cat out of the bag."
334;1307960;1310440;"About how the real Hunter Exam"
335;1311160;1313500;"hasn't ended yet."
336;1407260;1409680;"Next time: A x Dangerous x Watchdog!"
337;1409680;1411150;"Fetch, doggie!"
338;1411150;1411810;"That's it..."
339;1411810;1413170;"Roll over, doggie!"
340;1413170;1414600;"Oh, yeah!"
