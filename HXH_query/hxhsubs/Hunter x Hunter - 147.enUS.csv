1;2480;3600;"Something,"
2;4890;8090;"will you forgive me for being a"
3;10360;11710;"bad big brother?"
4;13160;14010;"'Kay."
5;21140;22340;"I..."
6;23420;24500;"love Killua."
7;26250;27910;"Don't make the same mistake."
8;28300;31950;"And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!"
9;32990;36970;"You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,"
10;36970;38100;"but either way, you should apologize!"
11;41110;43670;"When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule."
12;43670;44820;"Do you know it?"
13;44820;45650;"Huh?"
14;45650;47600;"No, what is it?"
15;48080;51760;"You promise to do things differently next time."
16;51760;54610;"And you keep that promise, no matter what."
17;56340;57280;"Uh-huh."
18;137990;142990;"Salvation x And x Future"
19;161370;165140;"She had red hair just like yours."
20;182030;184000;"I shot her because"
21;186120;188220;"I knew that the scumbags pursuing her"
22;188860;192300;"enjoyed keeping their prey alive to toy with."
23;194180;196070;"After my rebirth as an Ant,"
24;197280;201490;"I realized that I was doing the 
same things I'd done before."
25;211100;215530;"Before I was reborn this way, 
my job was to get rid of people."
26;217310;219470;"When ordered to, I pulled the trigger."
27;220660;224410;"I spent the rest of my time yelling at people."
28;226900;229010;"It was a job anyone could do."
29;231490;235580;"A ridiculous cycle that continues even after rebirth."
30;239060;243910;"I wanted to give her an escape from that cycle."
31;245020;247020;"I didn't know exactly how it all worked,"
32;247610;248600;"but..."
33;249600;254600;"I felt that if I let them capture her, 
torture her, then kill her,"
34;255920;257530;"the cycle would repeat itself."
35;261750;263490;"A dull life in the middle of nowhere,"
36;263930;267870;"but one lived in peace and quiet..."
37;268280;271740;"Until that life was suddenly ended 
by mindless violence."
38;272490;274130;"I pulled the trigger"
39;277380;280540;"with a prayer that she would escape that cycle."
40;284910;290280;"Regardless of my actions, 
the Queen ate hundreds of humans."
41;290880;295000;"And when they were reborn, only a few 
could remember their prior lives."
42;297110;302730;"It's possible that most of the human 
souls managed to safely escape."
43;303920;306160;"But I wanted to do something."
44;306810;310250;"I wanted to feel like I was helping them escape."
45;311650;315280;"If you're inside that body instead of her,"
46;315700;319190;"that probably means she escaped,"
47;319730;321790;"and I still haven't run into an Ant"
48;321790;327180;"who's told me I killed them in their prior life."
49;328040;331050;"Perhaps they were all able to escape."
50;333280;337430;"Before all this happened, I didn't believe 
in the human soul's existence."
51;338630;340690;"I believed that humans had"
52;340690;344740;"the same worth as flies or fleas, 
and that they only lived and then died."
53;346880;348790;"That the ego was nothing more"
54;348790;353950;"than a bug that arose because the human 
brain was slightly more complex."
55;357660;359090;"That there was nothing after death."
56;359520;364470;"Our bodies simply decomposed, 
turned to dust, and scattered."
57;365520;369970;"I believed those tiny fragments had no purpose."
58;373690;376300;"But now, here I am."
59;376840;378570;"And I'm repeating the cycle."
60;380870;382960;"My appearance is completely different,"
61;383420;386720;"but I'm doing the same stupid things as before."
62;389140;390610;"It made me think."
63;391240;395470;"I may be a fool, but I won't deny 
the things that I know now."
64;395930;398330;"And I don't want to ignore the 
things I don't understand."
65;401540;402960;"I died."
66;404300;407310;"I died, and my body was broken into tiny pieces."
67;409530;411540;"But that wasn't the end."
68;414020;419460;"The fragments that I believed were 
too small to retain any meaning"
69;419460;422760;"possessed a power I could have never imagined."
70;426350;430980;"Particles no larger than pollen from our perspective"
71;431480;434830;"have enough energy to impact our health"
72;435300;439290;"tens or hundreds of millions of years later."
73;440630;442900;"And our DNA, which is even smaller,"
74;443330;449920;"contains the vast amount of information that 
comprises us, all within a double helix."
75;451020;455410;"And that infinitesimally small 
size is a necessity for"
76;456410;460350;"the birth of the enormous space 
known as the universe."
77;462190;468430;"Just because something is small does 
not mean it produces less energy."
78;471140;476220;"The soul is probably small, but it has 
enough energy to repeat the cycle."
79;477710;481680;"Does that mean I was reborn to continue that cycle?"
80;482540;484560;"I don't know what the future holds."
81;485640;490310;"So this is nothing more than 
speculation on my part,"
82;491040;495280;"but something inside told me that I 
mustn't repeat the same things again."
83;495730;499850;"I'm guessing that I'm forced 
to repeat all of this because"
84;500380;505420;"there was something I failed to provide 
my soul with while I was alive."
85;510400;512090;"You know how the body"
86;512090;515130;"moves more slowly without 
the soul's encouragement..."
87;515610;518830;"In my case, I've always been driven by the thought"
88;518830;521420;"that I can't let things stay this way."
89;522750;524510;"I know it isn't right."
90;526090;529000;"I will repeat the cycle,"
91;529510;532250;"while thinking that I have to change things."
92;534250;536470;"Because I made the wrong choice."
93;537680;540160;"My target shouldn't have been that girl."
94;540700;544400;"It should have been the ones pursuing her."
95;548310;549980;"It's no big deal."
96;550400;553000;"It just means I was the biggest scumbag of all."
97;553820;559400;"The price for cleansing a tainted 
soul was too heavy,"
98;561090;562670;"so I avoided that."
99;563590;567310;"While selfishly praying that her soul would escape,"
100;567760;570880;"I was desperate to avoid getting hurt myself."
101;571410;574690;"I shot her to protect myself."
102;578640;583530;"And now, I'm trying to save myself again 
by confessing my sins to you,"
103;583530;586280;"the one who inherited her appearance."
104;590290;591560;"Really..."
105;593470;595250;"I'm a hopeless case."
106;596230;598780;"I appreciate your listening to my story."
107;600860;603410;"Wait. Don't run away."
108;607480;609670;"You come with me."
109;612070;613760;"Forever."
110;614480;616920;"You'll stay with the person you shot,"
111;617840;621080;"living life the only way you can."
112;621810;623590;"This is your duty."
113;624070;625930;"You have no choice."
114;626420;628440;"No one will allow you to take your own life"
115;628860;630440;"and hit the reset button."
116;630780;634440;"You must live and apologize to me every day."
117;634890;637990;"I'll keep you so busy, you'll never have time"
118;637990;641480;"to worry about what's right or wrong."
119;642270;644410;"You will apologize to me"
120;644410;646840;"and do the work I tell you to do,"
121;646840;648850;"as you devote your life to me."
122;652740;658610;"If you forget your current resolve and slip,"
123;658610;660630;"I will kill you."
124;662250;664220;"So you can focus on living."
125;671120;673690;"Kite, you have a visitor."
126;674580;675620;"Let them in."
127;701680;702900;"Kite?"
128;702900;703800;"Yeah."
129;706850;707770;"Sorry."
130;710510;713020;"Come. Sit."
131;728180;729290;"Sorry for what?"
132;743850;746800;"I wasn't able to fight by your side."
133;750030;751310;"I wasn't"
134;752100;753300;"strong enough."
135;757530;758320;"But..."
136;759370;761570;"Next time, I'll protect you!"
137;766250;771400;"It sounds like you did some 
crazy stuff to defeat Pitou."
138;771400;773800;"Yeah, I almost died..."
139;775090;780010;"However, that doesn't change the fact 
that you defeated an enemy I couldn't."
140;780960;783330;"I suppose I can soothe my ego by telling myself"
141;784020;786000;"that my judgment was correct."
142;787250;792670;"But I wouldn't be here now without 
help from Killua and everyone else."
143;793800;796600;"I didn't make it here by myself."
144;801120;804340;"It appears that we both needed more training."
145;815620;817640;"I heard that you met Ging-san."
146;818360;820000;"Did you talk to Ging?"
147;820000;820880;"Yeah."
148;824280;825810;"You should go back to him."
149;829320;831630;"I understand what you wanted to say."
150;832040;834140;"I'm glad you came to see me."
151;835560;838900;"If I need help, I promise to let you know."
152;839810;841480;"Say hi to Killua for me."
153;845050;847070;"We're friends now."
154;848390;852160;"So right now, go back to Ging-san."
155;854210;855100;"Okay."
156;875860;877050;"Sorry."
157;878390;879620;"Sorry for what?"
158;880100;883690;"I was trying to take the easy way out 
by running away from everything."
159;885790;887500;"No matter the pain, I will keep living."
160;888390;891760;"So when I die, I'll feel I did the best I could."
161;904480;905340;"Ging!"
162;914720;919230;"{\fad(528,1)}I'm waiting atop the World Tree."
163;920380;922330;"I tried to stop him..."
164;923840;929190;"Yeah, he didn't say that he 
would wait for me <i>here</i>..."
165;976180;977790;"It's huge!"
166;978500;981790;"This is definitely the tallest tree in the world."
167;989430;993200;"The World Tree stands at the city's center,"
168;993200;998620;"at a height of 1,784 meters."
169;998620;1005310;"Humans are still unable to build a taller structure."
170;1005860;1009070;"Climbing the tree is not forbidden,"
171;1009520;1013580;"but you must pay a fee and sign a written agreement."
172;1014540;1019430;"You can reach the 500-meter 
point by elevator or stairs,"
173;1019430;1022520;"but after that, you'll be risking your life."
174;1022990;1027240;"Every year, around 3,000 
people attempt the climb,"
175;1027240;1033030;"but 94% fail to reach the 1,000-meter 
point, and turn back."
176;1034090;1039740;"Another 4% are forced to pay an extremely 
pricey fee to be rescued from the tree,"
177;1039740;1043600;"and another 1% fall and die."
178;1044040;1049260;"Which means that, each year, 
only about 30 people make it"
179;1049260;1053430;"to the top and return safely."
180;1059930;1060870;"So..."
181;1064170;1065670;"This is as far as we're going."
182;1066620;1067710;"Yeah."
183;1067710;1069130;"Be careful."
184;1069560;1070510;"Yeah."
185;1073240;1076370;"Killua, thank you for everything."
186;1077300;1078140;"Yeah."
187;1078790;1080000;"Well,"
188;1080000;1083640;"after you told me you would defeat Pitou alone"
189;1083640;1086570;"and that it was none of my business,"
190;1086570;1090070;"I was pretty depressed!"
191;1091980;1094450;"I'm really sorry..."
192;1094850;1096080;"Brother!"
193;1098150;1100890;"Well, you apologized."
194;1101420;1105840;"And I think I can say I'm only here with Alluka 
now because of the time I spent with you."
195;1107420;1109920;"She's the one who healed you."
196;1110210;1111920;"Huh?! Is that true?"
197;1112620;1114840;"Why are you telling me now?"
198;1115150;1118940;"You should have told me sooner!"
199;1120000;1121010;"Sorry."
200;1122500;1125270;"We don't want too many people knowing about this."
201;1125270;1128340;"You know, it's sort of a complicated family thing..."
202;1128860;1130300;"Come with me!"
203;1132820;1135270;"Alluka, can you tell Something to come out?"
204;1135560;1136440;"Yeah."
205;1143500;1148620;"She has the power to grant any wish I make."
206;1149530;1150650;"Any wish?"
207;1151330;1156210;"Because of that power, 
she was locked up in our house."
208;1156850;1161220;"But thanks to you, she's outside now."
209;1161900;1165500;"And I'm prepared to spend the 
rest of my life protecting her."
210;1170390;1174430;"We should be the ones thanking you."
211;1174430;1175370;"'Kay."
212;1175850;1178080;"N-No way..."
213;1178080;1181240;"I should be thanking you!"
214;1192820;1196000;"This is no good. If we stay here any longer..."
215;1197610;1198520;"Yeah."
216;1205010;1208680;"I'll be traveling to all kinds of places with Alluka."
217;1208680;1210740;"I'll e-mail you from time to time."
218;1210740;1212280;"Me, too."
219;1212820;1215470;"If anything comes up, let me know."
220;1215470;1216930;"I'll do the same."
221;1216930;1219170;"Yeah, I will."
222;1219170;1221540;"Since you owe me a lot..."
223;1222790;1224450;"Say hi to your dad for me."
224;1224450;1225540;"Yep."
225;1225540;1228790;"I want to go with you, but I have to watch Alluka."
226;1229550;1231940;"And you haven't had a chance to talk alone yet."
227;1232390;1233470;"See you around."
228;1234000;1238300;"After I've had my brother all to 
myself for a while, I'll set him free."
229;1238770;1240890;"Will you hang out with him then?"
230;1240890;1241920;"Hold on!"
231;1241920;1244140;"I'm the one choosing to hang out with him!"
232;1244140;1245480;"Isn't she a great sister?"
233;1245480;1248310;"Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, 
you're in second place."
234;1269650;1273460;"Kite said that no matter where we go,"
235;1273460;1275130;"we'll always be friends!"
236;1276390;1277330;"Yeah!"
237;1397840;1398730;"Bye!"
238;1398730;1399700;"Later!"
239;1404760;1407300;"Next time: Past x And x Future."
240;1407300;1409670;"I'll introduce you to Ging eventually!"
241;1409670;1411200;"Yeah, that's a promise."
242;1411200;1413130;"So until we meet again!"
243;1413130;1414110;"Yeah!"
