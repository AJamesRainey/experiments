the number of invalid votes."

31;161840;165940;"Hunters who violate the rules by 
abstaining or submitting invalid votes"

33;168660;170690;"Those are my two suggestions."
34;171110;174310;"If we implement the first, 
do we still need the second?"
35;174310;179200;"Just getting rid of the invalid 
votes would put us over 95%."
36;180270;181760;"I wouldn't be so sure..."
37;182060;186750;"Some Hunters may play hooky when they 
learn they can't submit invalid votes."
38;186750;190190;"There are those who would trample 
on the former chairman's wishes."
39;190190;191060;"What?"
40;191060;193450;"Drop it. You'll only waste time."
41;193880;196460;"Oh? Did I say something wrong?"
42;197230;201550;"The former chairman declared that 
a 95% turnout was required,"
43;201550;204600;"so Hunters who submit invalid votes or 
won't vote are betraying his memory."
44;205000;208350;"They just don't want to see you become chairman!"
45;208700;212020;"Then they should vote for someone else."
46;212370;215510;"I'm sure there are other qualified candidates."
47;215870;219110;"Though that isn't how the majority of Hunters feel..."
48;219840;224490;"Is that too hard for you, with your limited 
vocabulary and math skills?"
49;231060;233120;"I told you that you'd only waste time."
50;233800;235630;"You get a warning, Kanzai."
51;236160;240020;"Before adding new rules, 
I believe we should broadcast"
52;240020;241880;"each candidate's message."
53;242200;246050;"Besides, abstaining and submitting invalid 
votes are not technically violations."
54;246050;249030;"I fully agree with your first statement,"
55;249030;251140;"but the second makes me 
wonder if I heard right..."
56;251850;254340;"I cannot believe those words came from one"
57;254340;257150;"of the former chairman's leading supporters."
58;257840;259050;"The former chairman said"
59;259050;261560;"that the difficulty of this election was D-rank."
60;261560;266780;"Which means, for us Hunters with stars, 
this should be a simple task."
61;267040;271290;"In other words, the former chairman 
trusted us to handle this."
62;271290;272740;"Pariston, you're a pain!"
63;272740;274290;"Don't talk! Keep your mouth shut!"
64;274900;281310;"The difficulty level is just his way of 
expressing his degree of trust in the Zodiacs."
65;281310;282940;"If it's S, he's encouraging us."
66;282940;285510;"If it's F, he's challenging us."
67;285800;287760;"You can spin it however you want,"
68;287760;290930;"but abstaining and submitting invalid 
votes don't violate any rules, scumbag."
69;291330;293210;"When I called them violations..."
70;293210;296710;"I was only insinuating that those 
Hunters are mistaken in their manner"
71;296710;299060;"of paying respects to the former chairman."
72;299500;302990;"The message is that making the election 
a success would be the right way"
73;302990;304810;"to pay our respects to him."
74;304810;306890;"Then, say that during your speech!"
75;306890;309070;"If you make it a rule, that's coercion!"
76;309620;312510;"Is coercion such a bad thing?"
77;312910;314710;"Okay, I get the idea..."
78;314710;315940;"That's enough."
79;315940;318330;"I'm fine with both suggestions."
80;318800;321410;"My reasons are different than yours,"
81;321410;324480;"but I agree that, barring 
extraordinary circumstances,"
82;324480;327190;"no Hunters should be abstaining 
or submitting invalid votes."
83;327190;329640;"Then let's take a vote."
84;329640;330850;"First things first."
85;331750;334240;"I hope you aren't going to say that, 
during that time, Hunters who"
86;334240;337590;"have their licenses taken away 
aren't considered pro Hunters."
87;337590;340230;"You aren't that stupid, are you?"
88;342210;343730;"Of course not..."
89;344220;349140;"I wouldn't think of using such underhanded 
logic to manipulate the vote."
90;349140;351490;"Their licenses will be confiscated. Nothing more."
91;351490;352850;"What if they're lost?"
92;353790;356640;"A Hunter who has lost his license"
93;356640;359240;"may be protected by the rules,"
94;359240;362380;"but is not qualified to be a pro 
as far as we're concerned, yes?"
95;363770;365130;"Uh..."
96;365680;367580;"Are you saying that someone"
97;367580;371450;"would use the threat of a license going 
missing to manipulate the vote?"
98;372220;374890;"We can't guarantee no one will do that."
99;375740;378140;"Let this be clearly recorded in the minutes..."
100;378700;381900;"Hunters who lose their licenses during the election"
101;381900;384530;"will not lose their right to vote."
102;385100;391060;"That way, no one can manipulate 
the turnout or the majority."
103;396370;397950;"I hate to admit it,"
104;397950;401540;"but unless we do something about 
the majority, not just the turnout,"
105;401540;404290;"Pariston will keep smiling."

113;423980;426580;"wishes that Ging were here."
114;431110;434250;"A beast that cannot be tamed..."
115;437820;441660;"Why did the Chairman select 
him as Vice Chairman?"
116;452690;456210;"Since I get to choose my second-in-command,"
117;456210;458350;"choosing a yes-man wouldn't be any fun."
118;459150;462100;"It should be someone I can't stand..."
119;462570;466450;"That is who I want at my side."
120;469450;470360;"Chairman,"
121;471740;475600;"I still believe you made a mistake."
122;483010;484910;"Young Killua has returned?"
123;485810;487050;"That's great..."
124;487420;490900;"When I saw his name on the list of Hunters 
who didn't vote, I was worried."
125;490900;492240;"How's he doing?"
126;506300;508460;"He's opened Testing Gates 1 through 5?"
127;509130;512400;"Actually, his expression was what concerned me."
128;513030;515010;"He looked very distressed..."
129;515010;518360;"I couldn't bring myself to speak to him."
130;519160;523410;"If you run into his friend there, 
can you relay a message?"
131;524040;527400;"Ask him to help young Killua."
132;527400;528040;"Well..."
133;530570;534170;"His friend is why he's upset."
134;535200;537820;"What? Gon-kun?"
135;542870;543930;"Young Killua..."
136;567150;568920;"Let me see Alluka."
137;570080;571800;"I need her power."
138;573200;574240;"Killua..."
139;574640;576930;"I don't have time, Dad!"
140;577610;580130;"I'll go even if you try to stop me, so come with me."
141;580770;581740;"It's useless."
142;583100;585430;"No one can control Alluka."
143;585610;587420;"That's wrong!"
144;587420;589060;"You're wrong... Brother's wrong..."
145;589340;590900;"Alluka's a member of the family!"
146;590900;592070;"She isn't a machine!"
147;592870;595810;"As her brother, I'm asking her for help!"
148;598100;600420;"For help?"
149;604930;605830;"That child"
150;606610;608080;"is not human."
151;609430;610960;"You shouldn't consider"
152;611460;613460;"that thing to be a member of the family."
153;614650;615710;"What did you say?"
154;625940;627240;"That thing"
155;628270;630170;"is something that came"
156;632740;634050;"from somewhere else."
157;663810;664890;"Sit."
158;670040;673540;"If someone tries to dispel the restriction 
and covenant Gon set for himself,"
159;674150;677400;"they'll be either repelled or killed."
160;679620;681690;"If Alluka hasn't changed,"
161;681690;684660;"I'm the only one who can help her."
162;685540;689660;"And Alluka's the only one who can save Gon."
163;694070;695290;"Promise me one thing."
164;696520;698590;"Never betray your friends."
165;699810;704180;"If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, 
wouldn't I be betraying him?"
166;709160;710180;"Come with me."
167;782070;784040;"I'm sure you already know this,"
168;784490;787390;"but no new requests have been made."
169;788460;790470;"Who made the last wish?"
170;791310;792390;"Milluki."
171;793790;796820;"He asked for the newest computer 
available at the time."
172;797750;801420;"He made the wish himself in Alluka's 
presence, so he couldn't lie."
173;803100;807100;"A computer shouldn't be that bad..."
174;810000;814090;"Was it because Illumi was controlling me?"
175;815720;820670;"How could I leave my little 
sister in this situation?"
176;821790;824550;"Killua, I want to go over this again."
177;826040;828840;"When making a wish to Alluka, 
what are the rules?"
178;829530;830500;"It's not necessary..."
179;830790;833760;"I know Alluka better than anyone."
180;833760;834560;"It's necessary."
181;835420;837590;"Have you forgotten how many people have died?"
182;838150;840290;"We've killed more people!"
183;841390;842190;"Killua,"
184;842960;846400;"if you can't stay calm, we're stopping now."
185;847190;853950;"Our promise matters to me because 
I care about you, as your father."
186;855180;857210;"Can you go over the rules for me?"
187;861440;862650;"Alluka is..."
188;868220;870840;"Mitsuba... Mitsuba!"
189;871470;873100;"Carry me."
190;873100;875330;"Yes, yes... I will!"
191;875900;877110;"There!"
192;877930;879960;"Climb the stairs!"
193;879960;881190;"Yes, yes."
194;882010;884110;"Raise me up high!"
195;884110;884860;"Yes, yes."
196;885400;886100;"There you go!"
197;886900;888280;"Mitsuba..."
198;888280;891620;"Yes, yes? What is it, Master Alluka?"
199;905060;908260;"Yes... Master Alluka's 
face suddenly changed!"
200;909210;912640;"Yeah, it's okay. I can handle this."
201;914260;917460;"Alluka, lift me up high!"
202;917910;918890;"'Kay."
203;919350;920890;"Up high..."
204;921530;922900;"Up high..."
205;924550;925570;"'Kay."
206;925570;926900;"See? She's back."
207;927670;929230;"Keep this a secret from everyone."
208;929230;932400;"Oh, I already told your mother..."
209;932400;933160;"What?"
210;933570;936460;"But it was our secret!"
211;938530;940790;"It happens after three requests are fulfilled..."
212;941460;944290;"Yep, her eyes turn black."
213;944730;947750;"And they turn back after Alluka lifts you up high?"
214;947750;953430;"No, then Alluka grants a wish."
215;953940;956690;"I didn't understand at first..."
216;956690;961050;"So I wished for her to tell me 
how to turn her eyes back,"
217;961050;962940;"and Alluka told me."
218;963950;967690;"Do you remember the exact words Alluka said?"
219;968910;972200;"After she grants a wish, her eyes turn white."
220;973150;976700;"And when three of her requests 
are fulfilled, they turn black."
221;984280;986960;"Refuse any requests that Alluka makes."
222;987600;989690;"No matter how small they are."
223;989690;991980;"Yes, I understand."
224;994210;997010;"Mitsuba... Carry me!"
225;997370;999630;"I can't do that, Master."
226;1001670;1004210;"Then, Mitsuba, shake my hand."
227;1004210;1006400;"Oh, um..."
228;1006400;1007640;"I can't do that, Master."
229;1007640;1008770;"I'm sorry."
230;1009610;1012740;"Then I want a piggyback ride, Mitsuba."
231;1013210;1015470;"I'm sorry... I can't."
232;1015470;1016950;"What should I do?"
233;1018790;1020300;"Come on, Master!"
234;1020300;1022640;"Let's go catch some bugs."
235;1022640;1023500;"Okay?"
236;1023820;1027010;"Then, Mitsuba, lift me up high."
237;1027010;1030160;"I can't do that, either, Mast—"
238;1047820;1049470;"Mitsuba was in the play area..."
239;1049950;1051900;"Hasamu was in the butlers' quarters."
240;1052430;1055420;"So two people, in different locations,"
241;1055420;1059410;"were instantly crushed at the same time..."
242;1059790;1062420;"What is happening?"
243;1063020;1064410;"It's because she refused."
244;1066060;1068920;"She refused four of Alluka's requests."
245;1071980;1074300;"Yasuha, piggyback ride!"
246;1074780;1076430;"Yes, Master."
247;1091100;1092990;"Master Alluka..."
248;1094650;1098000;"Can you make me"
249;1098590;1100220;"a millionaire?"
250;1101650;1102520;"'Kay."
251;1122720;1123770;"'Kay."
252;1126390;1129550;"There has been a mysterious incident 
in which an airship transporting money"
253;1129550;1135060;"suddenly went missing, and when it 
was found, all the money was gone."
254;1136440;1140760;"The pilot and crew members have 
provided baffling explanations."
255;1140760;1144250;"It will take a while to determine the cause."
256;1145290;1147290;"I'm very sorry!"
257;1147290;1149050;"I couldn't help myself..."
258;1151130;1154000;"I find it hard to believe that 
this was just a coincidence."
259;1155000;1156970;"When Alluka is with us..."
260;1156970;1159760;"He never makes any requests."
261;1160510;1164740;"Dad, can you let me choose the next butler?"
262;1166920;1171250;"So your mission is to fulfill Alluka's requests."
263;1171720;1174270;"Yes... I understand."
264;1174520;1180100;"If you clear this mission, 
I will spare you and your lover."
265;1182600;1184340;"Hey, Kasuga..."
266;1184990;1186540;"Yes, what is it?"
267;1187490;1189040;"Give me your liver."
268;1190290;1192010;"Um, that's not..."
269;1192010;1193490;"You know?"
270;1193920;1195290;"You won't do it?"
271;1196790;1200300;"Then, Kasuga, give me your duodenum."
272;1201210;1203190;"Please wait, Master..."
273;1203190;1205850;"Let's play a different game! Okay?"
274;1206890;1208980;"You won't do it?"
275;1209720;1213100;"Then, Kasuga, give me your spine."
276;1214840;1215940;"Master!"
277;1216780;1219440;"Master... Please..."
278;1221300;1222950;"Then, Kasuga..."
279;1225630;1227660;"Give me your brain."
280;1234190;1239070;"When three of Alluka's requests are 
fulfilled, she'll grant one wish."
281;1240060;1244240;"There probably isn't any limit 
to the wishes she can grant."
282;1245540;1248720;"My guess is that she can grant any wish."
283;1248720;1253230;"Wish"
284;1249580;1253230;"But the bigger the wish she grants..."
285;1253980;1254480;"Request 1"
286;1254480;1254900;"Request 1                   Request 2"
287;1254900;1257730;"The bigger the next three requests will be."
288;1254900;1260610;"Request 3                  Request 1           Request 2"
289;1258380;1260150;"In other words, an equivalent exchange."
290;1262780;1266870;"And the sacrifice isn't made by the 
one whose wish was granted."
291;1267370;1270210;"It's the next person who fulfills the requests."
292;1268700;1271370;"Request 1                             Request 2"
293;1280680;1284300;"If someone denies four of 
Alluka's requests in a row,"
294;1284300;1288250;"that person and their most loved one,"
295;1288250;1292250;"meaning a minimum of two people, will die."
296;1293850;1298520;"The bigger the wish, the more people 
die when the requests aren't fulfilled."
297;1299800;1303640;"After that wish, sixty-seven people died, 
and those are just the ones we knew of."
298;1404420;1406760;"Thinking of the family that 
has been separated..."
299;1407200;1409900;"Thinking of the friend who is dying..."
300;1410340;1412300;"What will Killua do next?"
301;1412750;1415440;"Next time: Alluka x And x Something."
