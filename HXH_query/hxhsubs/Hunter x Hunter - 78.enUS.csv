nutritious organisms for me."
4;11900;12990;"At once!"
5;94990;100030;"Very x Rapid x Reproduction"
6;101960;105700;"Class-1 quarantined insects"
7;105700;109420;"and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants."
8;109850;113880;"Once they've evolved beyond 
two meters in length,"
9;113880;115920;"humans no longer stand a chance."
10;128950;130830;"Hey, what's that?"
11;137660;139700;"M-M-Monsters!"
12;140750;141880;"Listen carefully!"
13;141880;145010;"Target the fully grown ones. 
They will provide the most nutrition."
14;145010;145950;"Now go!"
15;179370;181080;"A Chimera Ant queen"
16;181080;184030;"moves repeatedly until she 
finds a place she likes."
17;184540;190450;"As she does, she births more and more 
soldier ants to build her own army."
18;191820;193420;"Once she's chosen a location,"
19;193420;198080;"she births a large number of carpenter ants, 
which construct her castle with incredible speed."
20;198590;202510;"From then on, the queen remains 
within the castle until death."
21;204850;209610;"So if a Queen grew to two meters tall"
22;209610;212020;"and were to set her sights on humans,"
23;212020;217350;"there should be entire villages 
or towns of missing people."
24;219470;220870;"I don't see anything..."
25;220870;223910;"I just checked the past six months,"
26;223910;226460;"and the largest group only numbered ten."
27;226460;229840;"Say, can we look up missing people individually?"
28;229840;231670;"Don't be ridiculous."
29;231670;235210;"You know how many hundreds of thousands 
of people go missing worldwide?"
30;235610;239320;"We should be able to see which areas 
have the highest concentrations."
31;241900;244470;"No good... The data's two years old."
32;245610;248500;"Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings."
33;248500;251810;"If someone saw a two-meter insect, 
they'd make a big fuss."
34;251810;253600;"We tried that, of course."
35;253600;256480;"But we couldn't find anything."
36;256860;259360;"Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing..."
37;259700;261100;"Yeah."
38;262490;265660;"Bring up the tidal data from 
the day the arm was found."
39;267550;270170;"The arm was discovered here..."
40;272420;274570;"Now go back ten days."
41;275630;281260;"Locate any currents that may have carried 
the arm to that location in that time."
42;281660;282860;"What do you mean?"
43;283270;285700;"It's possible that the arm"
44;285700;289670;"was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall."
45;289670;290850;"That makes sense."
46;294480;297020;"It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands..."
47;297330;300520;"Including the Mitene Union."
48;300890;301990;"The Mitene Union..."
49;302450;305280;"Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is."
50;305570;308530;"Yes, as well as East Gorteau."
51;309010;312150;"There's no getting information 
out of those two countries."
52;312150;313040;"What's this NGL?"
53;313530;316420;"An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life."
54;316750;321980;"It's a country founded by people who wanted to 
live in nature, away from machine civilization."
55;322660;323550;"Here."
56;325920;335180;"Mitene Union: 

{\3c&H42C095&}NGL Autonomous Region

60;335860;337300;"In '87,"
61;337300;340720;"a three-man TV crew was caught trying 
to enter the country to get a story."
62;340720;344190;"One was executed, and the 
other two remain in prison."
63;345110;350550;"Of its 2.17 million population, 
99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party,"
64;350550;352530;"with the rest being support volunteers."
65;353040;357080;"If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there,"
66;357080;359760;"how would the NGL citizenry react?"
67;361490;363410;"They probably wouldn't do anything."
68;363840;368670;"When a deadly epidemic spread throughout 
the area, they let nature run its course,"
69;369220;372720;"refusing to admit international doctors."
70;373150;378150;"And even if they tried to contact the outside, 
it would be too late by the time word arrived."
71;379050;382750;"If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen,"
72;383250;386790;"she may have already begun to build her nest."
73;391690;392690;"A contest?"
74;392690;393240;"Yeah..."
75;393890;395490;"Between you and me."
76;395490;399620;"Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans."
77;399620;401130;"I challenge you!"
78;401130;402050;"Hmph."
79;402050;403040;"What?"
80;403040;404240;"You're running away?"
81;404240;405530;"Hey, accept my challenge!"
82;406280;407380;"Accept?"
83;408740;410510;"Are you issuing an order?"
84;412160;415390;"Why should I follow an order from you?"
85;416460;419390;"I can only follow the Queen's orders."
86;419730;422450;"You're just scared of losing."
87;422450;425490;"My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers."
88;425490;428150;"I can beat any squadron in this castle!"
89;428540;430020;"Oh, I know..."
90;430020;434190;"I should get the other squadron leaders in on this."
91;434190;437290;"If we all compete, we'll capture more prey."
92;437710;439010;"More prey?"
93;439530;440530;"I see..."
94;440890;442470;"I agree with that idea."
95;442840;446300;"If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased."
96;446770;448560;"Okay, that settles it."
97;448990;451900;"However, I believe that the 
prey's quality also matters."
98;451900;456340;"We must ensure that the Queen 
eats highly nutritious humans."
99;457000;459560;"That guy's such a stiff..."
100;460320;462810;"That's what makes him endearing."
101;462810;466250;"He is dedicated and loyal."
102;466250;471070;"I presume the human he was created 
from was also quite earnest."
103;503430;504890;"Hey, wait!"
104;504890;507230;"Weren't you supposed to get some rest?"
105;507890;509780;"I'll bring her back."
106;509780;511740;"Don't bother, it won't help."
107;512150;515330;"But she goes to the forest every morning,"
108;515330;517660;"and she spends the whole day searching."
109;517660;521490;"Right, she'll probably collapse soon..."
110;521490;524750;"But she can't stop looking."
111;525070;527810;"That's what it means to be a parent."
112;529350;534270;"How many days has it been since 
Kurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?"
113;534270;536920;"It's like spirits whisked them away."
114;544610;546040;"Big bugs..."
115;546040;547150;"Huh?"
116;552060;554280;"We haven't raided this area yet."
117;585810;587280;"Mom!"
118;589490;591250;"It must be them..."
119;591250;595950;"Those monsters must have stolen your children!"
120;613590;614970;"Excellent."
121;614970;618970;"This should suffice to please the Queen."
122;630340;632230;"Wh-What's happening?"
123;632900;634730;"Exterminate the insects quickly."
124;635730;637740;"That's Gyro's order."
125;638090;639990;"Gyro? What's that?"
126;640610;642570;"Our king's name!"
127;650590;651700;"Damn!"
128;658020;661720;"I bought tickets to the Mitene Union."
129;662120;664990;"But to reach NGL, we have to"
130;664990;668710;"take an airship to the neighboring 
Republic of Rokario,"
131;668710;671230;"and travel by land from there."
132;671230;674690;"It "ant" gonna be easy to get into 
a country of such nasty rumors."
133;674690;675480;"Just kidding."
134;677250;678490;"Nasty rumors?"
135;678490;679490;"What do you mean?"
136;682050;683870;"Have you heard of D²?"
137;683870;685240;"D²?"
138;686220;690750;"It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly 
throughout urban areas worldwide."
139;691680;695410;"It's derived from the bila tree, 
native to the Mitene Union."
140;696520;699120;"And they claim"
141;699120;704510;"that over 80% of the world's 
bila trees are located in NGL."
142;704750;709020;"So the nasty rumors are saying that the 
drug is being manufactured in NGL?"
143;709690;711360;"They're only rumors."
144;711640;714350;"No one has been able to publicly prove it."
145;714350;716520;"After all, the country's locked down tight."
146;716890;721030;"When people try to get in to 
investigate, they're executed."
147;721480;722730;"Executed..."
148;725300;726530;"He wasn't executed?"
149;728150;733120;"No, if he'd been captured trying 
to uncover NGL's secrets,"
150;733120;737170;"he'd have probably been executed 
like that TV crewman."
151;737540;740130;"But this reporter was wearing a wire,"
152;740130;744160;"from which we intercepted the final message."
153;744600;746430;"When the message was played..."
154;746820;748720;"M-Monsters..."
155;748720;750410;"Giant bugs!"
156;752700;754440;"Giant bugs?"
157;756010;757150;"What do you think?"
158;758990;761680;"That isn't enough information to be sure..."
159;764840;769080;"As a Magical Beast Hunter, 
I'll have to see for myself."
160;769490;770900;"Then that settles it."
161;770900;773140;"I'll get three tickets."
162;773140;774330;"Make it four."
163;776510;777460;"Ponzu..."
164;777460;779150;"I'm coming with you."
165;779150;779910;"You can't."
166;779910;781220;"This is too dangerous,"
167;781220;783690;"and you don't have a professional license yet."
168;783690;785930;"And we're talking about NGL..."
169;785930;787470;"That's why I should come."
170;788120;791130;"You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL."
171;791130;794000;"If they discover you with cell phones 
or wireless communicators,"
172;794000;796480;"you'll be arrested right away."
173;796740;800180;"So if there's any trouble, you'll need me..."
174;800180;803380;"Or rather, you'll need them."
175;809080;812120;"They can carry a letter anywhere."
176;814450;815500;"I get it."
177;815500;817180;"They'll certainly come in handy."
178;829120;831530;"It may be a bit late to ask,"
179;832160;833890;"but are you sure you want to come?"
180;833890;835020;"Of course!"
181;835020;837390;"You weren't kidding about the "late" part."
182;838050;842400;"We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL."
183;843400;846560;"There may very well be a swarm 
of giant Chimera Ants already,"
184;846560;848830;"hunting humans down."
185;849430;852410;"If that turns out to be the case,"
186;852910;855710;"my priority will be saving them."
187;855710;858420;"So I may not be able to help you."
188;858970;861060;"You must be able to protect yourselves."
189;861060;863210;"If you want to come, that's the requirement."
190;863210;864930;"Okay, got it."
191;864930;865920;"We'll be fine."
192;867060;870740;"And if I'm the one who's in danger,"
193;871270;873180;"you should escape without me."
194;876410;877180;"Got it?"
195;895540;897490;"A pretty good haul."
196;899000;903100;"But it's not even half the size of 
what my squadron delivered..."
197;903960;905780;"My focus was quality."
198;906240;908470;"And I wasn't competing against you."
199;909840;910920;"Whatever."
200;911370;912710;"Anyway, did you hear?"
201;912710;915600;"That turtle guy ran into human resistance."
202;916510;917600;"Resistance?"
203;919600;920600;"Hmm,"
204;920890;923480;"those were probably guns."
205;923770;924900;"Guns?"
206;924900;928750;"Put simply, it's a barrel that launches 
metal projectiles called bullets"
207;928750;931860;"using the explosive force of gunpowder."
208;932310;935610;"It's one of the most commonly 
used human weapons."
209;935610;938620;"No idea what you're talking about..."
210;938620;941410;"If you want the details, read books."
211;941410;942700;"Books are wonderful."
212;942700;945990;"You can learn about how these 
human creatures think,"
213;945990;949380;"behave, and function as a society."
214;949380;952070;"Can you answer my question, then?"
215;952070;954780;"Do humans have armies too?"
216;954780;955970;"Armies?"
217;955970;959470;"Yes, that was an army."
218;959890;964810;"They belong to a military body 
led by an authoritative figure,"
219;964810;967570;"much like ourselves!"
220;968740;971780;"Ah, I have another question."
221;971780;974800;"They mentioned something about a name."
222;974800;976060;"A name?"
223;976840;978780;"I can't blame you for not understanding."
224;979410;983290;"Because it's a human idea 
we do not make use of."
225;983600;985440;"Put simply..."
226;987530;990450;"So it seems there are humans"
227;990450;993550;"capable of more than running and crying."
228;996030;998280;"I don't know why that should surprise you."
229;998280;1001060;"Given how different you and I are,"
230;1001320;1004650;"it's only natural that individual humans 
would have unique traits as well."
231;1006190;1009980;"After all, their blood flows through us."
232;1015840;1018240;"Assemble, squadron leaders!"
233;1021730;1024270;"Assemble, squadron leaders!"
234;1025510;1027500;"The Queen summons us."
235;1027940;1030120;"Assemble, squadron leaders!"
236;1031290;1034980;"Do you get a headache when 
the Queen calls to us?"
237;1035470;1038200;"Yeah, my ears start ringing."
238;1038820;1042850;"It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do."
239;1049680;1053380;"I shall now begin preparations 
for the King's birth."
240;1054950;1060410;"Every day, provide me with fifty humans."
241;1060410;1061580;"Yes, Majesty!"
242;1063690;1066980;"Your Majesty, may I ask a question?"
243;1066980;1068420;"Permitted. Speak."
244;1069400;1072670;"Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves,"
245;1072670;1075550;"with weapons to use against us."
246;1076100;1080020;"We must fortify our defenses,"
247;1080020;1083470;"in preparation for any potential attack."
248;1083810;1088420;"I have a few ideas... 
Would you care to hear them?"
249;1088420;1091190;"I shall let you decide your course."
250;1091190;1094740;"I must focus entirely on my son."
251;1095180;1098570;"Yes, and one more thing..."
252;1098570;1103080;"Would you allow us to have names?"
253;1103440;1105080;"What is a name?"
254;1105550;1111250;"It's like a code that can be 
used to identify each of us."
255;1112740;1115090;"Very well, do as you like."
256;1115410;1117780;"I am truly grateful!"
257;1122270;1124310;"How peculiar."
258;1124310;1127990;"They speak their minds and 
request to use these names."
259;1127990;1132140;"While bettering the race, they compete for glory,"
260;1132140;1134810;"leading to a stronger sense of individuality."
261;1139420;1143740;"I suppose I am also peculiar to 
find this change fascinating."
262;1144180;1150120;"Perhaps I, too, have traces 
of human blood within me."
263;1152870;1157380;"Regardless, I feel quite confident now."
264;1158190;1164390;"I can see you already, as though 
recalling a memory from my past."
265;1165700;1167570;"My King..."
266;1167570;1171650;"You shall stand atop this world!"
267;1180120;1183410;"Names... Quite amusing."
268;1185370;1187480;"The King's three Royal Guards."
269;1187860;1191240;"I shall name you myself."
270;1196840;1199170;"What did you just decide?"
271;1199540;1202090;"Remember what Kite said before we left?"
272;1202090;1205010;"That we should escape without 
him if he's in danger."
273;1205010;1208490;"Yeah, I don't think it was a choice..."
274;1208490;1209310;"Yeah."
275;1210110;1213510;"That's why neither of us said anything,"
276;1214620;1216860;"but I've been thinking."
277;1217480;1220650;"Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect,"
278;1220650;1223150;"to be in that much danger?"
279;1225120;1230360;"You said that Ging had a reason for 
bringing Kite and me together..."
280;1230360;1231250;"Yeah."
281;1231820;1234460;"You're probably right."
282;1234970;1237810;"I don't know the reason,"
283;1237810;1241250;"but I can't give up halfway, 
no matter what's going on."
284;1241610;1244470;"Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging."
285;1244830;1247700;"Of course, I could never forgive myself, either."
286;1249030;1250640;"So I won't run away."
287;1250640;1252150;"That's what I've decided."
288;1254740;1255730;"Man,"
289;1256240;1258270;"you had this totally serious expression,"
290;1258270;1260670;"so I was expecting something big."
291;1260670;1262520;"But it's just business as usual."
292;1262520;1264960;"Huh? I thought about this a lot."
293;1264960;1267780;"I even ran a bunch of mental simulations..."
294;1268910;1271310;"Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon."
295;1271310;1273750;"If someone said you should abandon them,"
296;1273750;1275640;"you'd never do it."
297;1276870;1280170;"You make it sound like I wasted 
my time considering it."
298;1280450;1282600;"Then what about you?"
299;1283190;1286760;"I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think 
about it when the time comes."
300;1286760;1288850;"You mean you might run away?"
301;1288850;1290600;"Depends."
302;1290600;1293770;"I can't say until it actually happens."
303;1294040;1295360;"Say for instance..."
304;1295360;1298600;"I can't tell you what I'd do in 
a hypothetical situation."
305;1298600;1300820;"I don't decide until it's time."
306;1304790;1310530;"The airship carrying the group 
heads for the Mitene Union,"
307;1310960;1317120;"still unaware of the cruel fate 
that lies in wait for them..."
308;1405300;1407800;"Next time: No x Good x NGL."
309;1407800;1409550;"Ready, start!"
310;1409550;1412760;"Does that mean the queen isn't her— hur hur..."
311;1413220;1415010;"And there's your outtake!"
