compound for a reunion with Alluka,"

3;17600;22250;"I'd say there were six other cases 
in which two people died..."
4;22840;26470;"Our mother didn't believe Killua, 
so that was another pair."
5;27400;30000;"Another pair died to satisfy her curiosity."
6;30380;31990;"Even after she was convinced,"
7;31990;36010;"she sacrificed two more pairs to verify 
how the other victims were chosen."
8;36900;38370;"Then Milluki"
9;38370;43140;"exchanged the lives of two pairs 
of tourists for some cheap toys."
10;43990;46370;"During that time, there were two major incidents."
11;47110;52730;"There were thirteen confirmed deaths in 
the first, and sixty-seven in the second."
12;54610;57150;"Kill him for me."
13;57660;59410;"Milluki was responsible for the first one."
14;60500;62460;"I want to be a millionaire."
15;63050;65670;"Yasuha, the butler, was 
responsible for the second."

17;156870;161810;"Sure, a few pictures are no problem, Muna-san."
18;162470;165420;"I'm just taking Alluka and Kalluto for a walk."
19;165970;169290;"Oh, they're my younger brothers."
20;188230;189740;"Incredible!"
21;192340;194000;"Hey, Muna..."
22;194000;195590;"Eat this."
23;195590;196040;"Hmm?"
24;197670;198480;"Huh?"
25;198480;200880;"Oh, sorry..."
26;201910;203960;"He likes to make requests."
27;203960;206910;"You only need to refuse."
28;209820;213760;"Kill him for me."
29;218630;221150;"Figuring out the tourist incident wasn't easy..."
30;221820;225820;"But since another butler paid the 
price for the butler's incident,"
31;226240;228200;"it was easy to track down the victims."
32;232880;235640;"After investigating, I realized something."
33;236380;238400;"The criteria that determines who dies"
34;238400;241520;"is different for more than two people."
35;242730;245540;"Perhaps there are different 
rules for when a pair dies,"
36;245540;249090;"and when many people die."
37;250490;254520;"Zoldyck butlers are trained in 
a facility on our property."
38;255920;258610;"At the exact moment Kasuga died,"
39;260380;267060;"every butler in her class at that 
facility was wrung to death."
40;268370;271190;"Her head teacher and specialized teachers also died."
41;271780;273760;"Butlers from other classes..."
42;274130;275780;"Friends from her orphanage..."
43;275780;277780;"Her foster parents and their parents..."
44;278330;281130;"All people she was close to."
45;282380;286640;"Still, that she liked all of her 
classmates was impossible, right?"
46;288110;292890;"It becomes clear when you look at her 
hospitalized biological mother."
47;293580;297670;"Every month, she could only meet 
her mother for half an hour."
48;299930;304620;"Records from Kasuga's student days say she 
loved her mother most in the world."
49;305400;308330;"But her mother, in the hospital, survived."
50;310180;314050;"Well, people change..."
51;314870;317800;"Love and hate are two sides of the same coin."
52;318080;322260;"I agree, but that wasn't the case here."
53;323240;325630;"It wasn't that she began to hate her mother."
54;326120;328450;"Rather, she found someone she loved more."
55;329660;333560;"Kasuga had just begun a relationship."
56;334810;339500;"She'd spent even less time with her lover 
than she had with her mother."
57;341080;342420;"But wait..."
58;343040;345120;"You didn't investigate her past after the fact."
59;345810;347820;"You chose her to test after learning her past."
60;348190;350570;"Oh, you could tell?"
61;351840;353580;"Yeah, that's right."
62;354270;356060;"We used her to confirm our suspicions."
63;356310;359460;"Since our butlers aren't allowed to 
have relationships, or they're killed."
64;360830;365880;"The first incident made it clear 
that this power was dangerous."
65;366890;371310;"Capable of destroying the Zoldyck 
family, if we didn't understand it."
66;375310;379990;"After investigating the first incident 
and reaching a conclusion,"
67;379990;381610;"the second incident confirmed it."
68;382260;385370;"If you fail to grant four of Alluka's requests,"
69;385830;388350;"you must pay with your life."
70;389670;392370;"When the price is two lives,"
71;392370;396250;"you and the person you love most will die."
72;397000;399370;"When more than two must be sacrificed,"
73;399370;402880;"you and the person you love most will die,"
74;403520;409730;"along with, in order, those you've 
spent the most time with."
75;412020;416310;"So Kasuga's mother didn't die because she 
hadn't spent enough time with her."
76;416310;419540;"And Kasuga's lover died, 
despite his short time with her."
77;424230;426110;"This is a problem."
78;426660;427600;"Isn't it?"
79;428410;432340;"Killua will make a wish to Alluka, to restore Gon."
80;433950;436490;"If Killua makes the wish"
81;436490;440000;"and lets someone else fulfill the requests,"
82;440000;441620;"there shouldn't be any problem."
83;443340;447280;"But I'm sure Killua will do things 
the other way around."
84;454400;455640;"Brother!"
85;456700;457680;"Alluka..."
86;458670;462290;"Killua will have someone else make the wish,"
87;462290;465180;"and will then attempt to fulfill the 
consequent requests himself."
88;467380;471470;"Sorry about leaving you down 
here for so long, Alluka."
89;472560;473660;"I'm sorry."
90;473660;476550;"It's okay! I'm really happy!"
91;478030;480550;"I've missed your scent..."
92;484370;488300;"The leader of the monsters was strong enough 
to force Netero to resort to the Rose."
93;488940;491230;"To defeat one of its subordinates,"
94;491940;498680;"Gon's restriction and covenant must 
have been harder on him than death."
95;495890;498680;"{\fad(314,1)}Restriction                                                                      Covenant"
96;499530;505130;"A wish to reverse that would far exceed 
the power of money and medical science."
97;506180;508280;"The wish will likely be granted."
98;509000;513070;"And then, Killua will do whatever 
he can to fulfill Alluka's requests."
99;513600;516360;"Killua will receive requests he cannot fulfill."
100;517220;521290;"Still, Killua will try his best, and fail halfway."
101;525000;526830;"Mission failed."
102;529140;532590;"The one he loves most, or the 
one he's spent most time with..."
103;533790;535340;"Either way,"
104;535930;538600;"the restored Gon will still die."
105;538600;539300;"Huh?"
106;539800;540660;"Huh?"
107;541750;542520;"Oh."
108;543490;544600;"Am I wrong?"
109;546850;551160;"When you mentioned that "both" would die,"
110;551690;554130;"were you referring not to Killua and Gon,"
111;554130;555860;"but to Killua and yourself?"
112;556230;558370;"Yes, that's right."
113;560280;564370;"I have issues, but you are just as bad."
114;564980;567960;"And if things go wrong,"
115;567960;571580;"it won't only be Killua, Gon, and me."
116;571580;574510;"Every Zoldyck will die."
117;575660;580330;"I'm thinking that this wish will cost 
tens of thousands of lives."
118;581150;582750;"So you'll probably die, too."
119;584000;587020;"That's why your comment surprised me."
120;590990;594030;"Oh, this is a problem..."
121;603260;605040;"Brother, die."
122;609210;611090;"Okay, sure."
123;612790;613550;"Bang!"
124;615480;620500;"I'll ask Killua to follow proper procedure 
when he makes his wish."
125;620500;623010;"I want you there, hidden."
126;623790;630750;"If Killua either refuses, 
or agrees, but you feel he's lying,"
127;632580;636280;"I want you to dispose of Alluka."
128;637680;639880;"He has no combat abilities."
129;640450;642610;"You can consider him an ordinary child."
130;646100;649460;"We just don't know where he came from."

thirty-three absentees."
139;671260;673840;"This time, we have sixty-eight absentees."
140;673840;675940;"More Hunters were absent."
141;676530;680390;"Is this because they previously 
submitted invalid votes,"
142;680390;682460;"which is no longer possible?"
143;682460;686450;"So they chose to put their licenses 
on the line by not voting at all?"
144;687700;689240;"What's going on?"
145;689240;691460;"Why would they go that far?!"
146;692130;694080;"Then it's okay if we take licenses"
147;694080;696960;"from anyone who's committed both offenses?"
148;697560;700380;"Yes, I suppose we have no choice."
149;704200;707220;"Cluck-san, this is the list."
150;707880;709920;"Please send them a letter 
that says these two things:"
151;710760;713080;"They must bring their licenses to headquarters."
152;713080;718270;"And that we expect them to explain their absences."
153;720630;722420;"I don't know..."
154;722420;725240;"Will that really be enough?"
155;725690;729790;"Once they lose their licenses, 
violators gain exemption from the rules."
156;730100;734630;"They no longer need to fear 
the penalty for not voting."
157;734960;738880;"Taking away their licenses was your idea!"
158;739270;742900;"Huh? But we put the proposal to a vote."
159;744350;747480;"Besides, everyone was against the idea"
160;747480;750140;"of temporarily stripping them of Hunter status."
161;750580;754930;"If my goal had been to quickly improve turnout,"
162;754930;756650;"then I would have agreed."
163;757340;760750;"Yes, he's hard to deal with"
164;760750;764460;"because he readily accepts 
suggestions that hurt him."
165;764460;766660;"And he'll even propose ideas 
disadvantageous to him."
166;768800;772310;"It's as though he enjoys the obstacles."
167;775050;778310;"That's the one aspect that's 
similar to Chairman Netero."
168;779030;780570;"And I don't like it!"
169;782380;783970;"So I have a proposal."
170;784960;788010;"I think the twelve Zodiacs should give a speech"
171;788010;790470;"before all of the Hunters."
172;790860;793180;"We must express this election's importance!"
173;793180;794690;"For the Association..."
174;794690;796130;"For humanity..."
175;796130;798000;"For the world!"
176;798670;802290;"Speaking through a screen is no good."
177;802290;804160;"We must look each of them in the eye,"
178;804160;808010;"and let them hear our voices, 
and feel our souls in person."
179;808370;810660;"For the sake of the former chairman!"
180;811670;813150;"This is why"
181;813910;816500;"I hate your guts, Pariston!"
182;821080;824510;"Brother, wake up!"
183;834300;835120;"Boo!"
184;837000;839400;"You're so good!"
185;839860;844020;"Alluka's power has rules the rest of 
the family doesn't know about."
186;846810;849440;"Brother, let's play shiritori."
187;849440;850910;"Okay, sure."
188;851400;853030;"Then..."
189;855540;857120;"I'll start with the ending "A" in "Alluka"!"
190;857120;860840;"The one that calls me "Brother" is the real Alluka."
191;861710;863520;"The one that calls me "Killua""
192;865160;866560;"is something else."
193;875610;878560;"Brother, pat my head."
194;880840;881970;"Sure."
195;902930;906130;"Killua's being a model big brother."
196;906880;909500;"That's three requests down."
197;909960;912190;"So a computer was no big deal..."
198;919850;921790;"S-S-Sorry, Papa..."
199;921790;923480;"I won't do it again!"
200;924850;928490;"That means Alluka is ready."
201;928730;932480;"Yep, Killua just has to make his wish."
202;933470;936290;"Milluki, I want you to go over the rules again."
203;936290;937750;"Ah, sure."
204;938240;940750;"I'm aware of five rules."
205;941470;942250;"One."
206;942560;946460;"When someone fails to fulfill one of 
Alluka's requests, causing them to reset,"
207;946460;949850;"the request difficulty returns to level 1."
208;950390;953750;"That's the best time to make a wish to Alluka."
209;954990;955800;"Two."
210;955800;958830;"Once Alluka starts making requests to someone,"
211;958830;961830;"he will not switch his requests 
to someone different."
212;963100;966850;"That's why I always ensured 
that Alluka made a request"
213;966850;970660;"to a butler before sending 
him to you and Mama."
214;971850;974280;"I'd guess Killua did the same thing."
215;975150;979750;"That's why Alluka has never made 
any requests of you two."
216;981640;982760;"Three."
217;982760;986340;"If the person receiving Alluka's requests 
dies before clearing them all,"
218;986340;988300;"it's considered a failure,"
219;988790;991120;"and at least one more will die."
220;992180;994400;"This was confirmed by experiment."
221;995160;996110;"Four."
222;996110;1000310;"If he doesn't know someone's name, 
Alluka can't make requests of them."
223;1001030;1001940;"Five."
224;1001940;1006940;"The same person can't make two wishes in a row."
225;1007530;1008470;"That's all I know."
226;1009320;1011630;"I'm not hiding anything from you!"
227;1011630;1013230;"I swear on the deal we made."
228;1022820;1026210;"Why isn't Killua making a wish?"
229;1028160;1031210;"He probably has some foolish idea..."
230;1031710;1034330;"If Killua makes a wish now,"
231;1034330;1037720;"someone else will have to clean up the mess."
232;1038700;1040200;"That makes no sense."
233;1041020;1043490;"Can he not save his friend first,"
234;1043490;1045730;"and worry about the consequences later?"
235;1046950;1047790;"Papa..."
236;1049230;1052280;"Would his friend be happy to know"
237;1052280;1055210;"that many lives were sacrificed to save him?"
238;1055600;1056490;"No!"
239;1057180;1059530;"That's what's going through his head."
240;1060010;1060990;"Since he's stupid."
241;1062210;1065420;"His mind doesn't work the way ours do."
242;1065940;1069000;"That's why you had Illu-nii use 
his needles on him, right?"
243;1072590;1073690;"He's moving."
244;1083430;1085690;"Father, open the door."
245;1090590;1091440;"No."
246;1091920;1093530;"Make the wish in that room."
247;1094820;1097410;"We cannot let you go outside."
248;1100790;1102000;"As I thought."
249;1103270;1106540;"They don't know about any of these rules."
250;1108570;1109670;"Father,"
251;1110790;1112880;"I am definitely your son."
252;1121130;1123560;"You called Alluka "something that 
came from somewhere else.""
253;1124510;1125760;"Right?"
254;1127240;1132600;"I call the black-eyed Alluka "Something," too."
255;1136320;1137610;"We're leaving."
256;1139300;1142230;"I'll clean up my own mess."
257;1144240;1145330;"Something,"
