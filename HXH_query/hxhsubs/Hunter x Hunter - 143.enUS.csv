from me about Alluka."

and use it to escape?"
181;728600;731520;"Or do I go back to the airship 
and try to escape by air?"
182;732240;734380;"If I were alone, those options would work."
183;734380;737470;"But it'd be hard to manage 
that and keep Alluka safe."
184;739260;740960;"How did you know we were here?"
185;741620;745970;"If I tell you, will you give me Alluka?"

187;747780;748970;"I won't ask."
188;749990;753480;"Alluka has an ordinary child's strength."
189;754010;757320;"A single attack from one of the 
Needlemen could be lethal."

197;787350;791880;"She probably transmitted the 
video to you, Master Illumi."
198;791880;795020;"Bingo. Tsubone served as my spy."
199;796550;798810;"When the clouds cleared,"
200;798810;802980;"I felt eyes on me again and realized the truth."
201;802980;806160;"The timing was too perfect."
202;806530;811040;"Ah, so you actually felt us watching..."
203;811040;812660;"You're really something."
204;814090;816440;"Well, now you know the truth,"
205;816440;820150;"but you can't remove that scope because 
Mom ordered you to wear it."
206;820720;823920;"Yes, you're completely right."
207;824740;825920;"Tsubone,"
208;826570;828930;"give me the nail from your middle finger."
209;832960;835430;"Yes, absolutely."
210;837630;839690;"Here you are, Master."
211;842980;846700;"Tsubone, give me the nail 
from your ring finger."
212;847250;851050;"Yes, that's easy enough."
213;853440;856120;"Tsubone, I appreciate it."
214;863550;865520;"Now, Master Killua..."
215;865520;867980;"Make your wish."
216;867980;871720;"Amane and I will take care of the rest."
217;872990;879620;"Please allow me this opportunity to 
make amends for impeding your mission."
218;881310;882920;"Are you going to do it?"
219;882920;884520;"Fine..."
220;884520;889610;"That means when you save Gon, 
you'll follow the same process, right?"
221;890650;894400;"If you'd sacrifice those two to kill me,"
222;894400;898780;"you won't have any problem sacrificing 
a bunch of strangers to save Gon."
223;900320;901510;"Rule 5..."
224;901980;905480;"The same person can't make 
two wishes in a row."
225;908220;913260;"Would it be more fun to kill Alluka, 
earning Killua's wrath,"
226;913630;918860;"or more fun to spare Alluka and save 
Gon, making Illumi my enemy?"
227;921650;923650;"Tough call..."
228;925030;928610;"If you say yes, I'll be happy to die."
229;928970;931700;"Your inner mission will have succeeded."
230;932960;935940;"It's against the rules for family 
members to kill one another,"
231;935940;938540;"but the thing that will grant your wish..."
232;940320;942150;"isn't family."
233;948110;952260;"Assuming there's a secret rule that 
makes rule 5 not apply to Killua..."
234;952790;956590;"If my death means no other family 
will die, that's acceptable."
235;958210;960920;"Killua will suffer for the rest of his life."
236;961640;965750;"I will live in his heart forever."
237;968250;969780;"Go ahead, then."
238;970620;973220;"I'm offering a deal, Kil..."
239;973870;978450;"My death in exchange for your word 
that you yourself will make the wish"
240;978780;979960;"to save Gon."
241;983030;986030;"Alluka lives while Illumi dies,"
242;986030;987850;"but I don't earn Killua's wrath."
243;987850;991840;"So if Gon is healed, I neither gain nor lose anything."
244;993420;994720;"In that case,"
245;995820;998720;"I will kill Alluka to earn Killua's wrath,"
246;999450;1003010;"then take out Killua to earn Illumi's wrath."
247;1003530;1005550;"That is the best choice..."
248;1014300;1015360;"Something,"

250;1024980;1025920;"'Kay."
251;1029830;1032060;"Hand. Hand."
252;1032060;1034570;"Tsubone, put out your left hand."
253;1035370;1038030;"Master Killua, but..."
254;1038030;1038820;"Just do it."
255;1046210;1051030;"Something is skilled at destroying, 
but fixing isn't her forte."
256;1052050;1055580;"When she's fixing, she must touch the target."
257;1056820;1057790;"But..."
258;1061530;1062520;"'Kay."
259;1062950;1065710;"Killua, pat my head!"
260;1066440;1067930;"Of course, I will."
261;1068610;1070670;"That was amazing, Something."
262;1077980;1080380;"Something is the one who calls me "Killua.""
263;1081340;1085110;"Healing someone is tiring, 
so Something must sleep."
264;1085670;1087680;"But that's it."
265;1089350;1096560;"Something has never made a cruel 
request after healing someone!"
266;1098280;1100330;"Something is kinder than anyone."
267;1101730;1104490;"The one who's cursed is the one who wishes."
268;1106880;1109210;"If you refer to Something as an object again,"
269;1110680;1112820;"I won't consider you my brother anymore."
270;1119110;1121220;"Got it, Kil."
271;1122070;1127460;"If you can heal Gon without any risk, that's terrific."
272;1128710;1133110;"But that doesn't change the fact 
that Something is dangerous,"
273;1133520;1136260;"and my questions remain unanswered."
274;1137760;1141420;"Kil, you're still hiding something."
275;1141970;1145670;"Such as how Milluki's rule 5 doesn't apply to you."
276;1147150;1151620;"Until you tell me everything, 
I won't let Alluka go."
277;1153810;1155090;"Stupid!"
278;1155490;1157430;"That's why I can't tell you anything."
279;1157980;1160950;"If you knew the last rule, you'd..."
280;1161290;1163010;"No, all of you..."
281;1163930;1168320;"would put needles in my head again."
282;1171220;1174520;"Master Killua, I will take you to the hospital."
283;1176310;1179530;"Captain Bushidora, of the Seirin Group,"
284;1179890;1185590;"was killed in pursuit of the wicked Hunter 
that we hoped to bring to justice."
285;1186280;1191620;"This confirms that demons are hiding among us!"
286;1191810;1197090;"However, I regret to say that the Seirin Group"
287;1197090;1202130;"does not have the power to bring the 
Hunter, or Hunters, to justice."
288;1202640;1205330;"Everyone! This is an urgent matter"
289;1205330;1208300;"that the Association must band 
together to resolve at once!"
290;1208790;1215030;"That is why our goal is to ensure 
that voter turnout exceeds 95%,"
291;1215030;1218630;"and that the winner has a majority!"
292;1219440;1224170;"Thus, we are currently in negotiations 
with Morel, who has strong ties with"
293;1224170;1227490;"the former chairman's faction, in hopes 
that he will be our new captain."
294;1227490;1233070;"At the same time, we are prepared 
to reveal the name, face, and abilities"
295;1233070;1236550;"of this demon to prevent further tragedy."
296;1236940;1241150;"If you agree with our ideals, please..."
297;1242800;1246380;"cast a vote for Teradein!"
298;1247780;1250480;"Oh, uh..."
299;1251020;1253640;"I'm pretty sure I turned you down."
300;1253990;1255680;"Can't you reconsider?"
301;1256530;1259410;"I agree that I was fairly close 
to the former chairman,"
302;1259410;1261400;"and I participated in the Ant extermination."
303;1261820;1264280;"But I'm not a warrior."
304;1264820;1267650;"It was determined that my support was required,"
305;1267650;1269580;"given the nature of the operation."
306;1269580;1271550;"I wouldn't say that I'm strong."
307;1271550;1272660;"But..."
308;1273050;1275330;"Didn't you watch them introduce the top sixteen?"
309;1275330;1276760;"I'm a Sea Hunter!"
310;1276760;1279300;"I belong in the water. I'm a water man."
311;1279300;1280740;"I don't belong on land."
312;1280740;1282170;"Can't you adapt?"
313;1282770;1285490;"And if you're in a hurry to end the election,"
314;1285490;1289370;"you could tell your supporters to vote for Pariston!"
315;1290120;1293350;"Though, I'd rather die than vote for him..."
316;1295060;1296680;"One last thing."
317;1296680;1298190;"If you release his identity,"
318;1298610;1303410;"you and a bunch of other fools will end up dying."
319;1303890;1307320;"And don't use the "Seirin Group" 
name when you're so weak!"
320;1307550;1311380;"I'm not interested in teaming up with 
people who won't heed my warnings,"
321;1311380;1313450;"and I'm not interested in becoming chairman."
322;1313450;1314290;"I'm done!"
