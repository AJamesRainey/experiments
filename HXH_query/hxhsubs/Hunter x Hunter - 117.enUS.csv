1;3700;8290;"Why?!"
2;27540;29440;"You have it easy, Killua."
3;31040;32770;"You're perfectly calm."
4;36000;38020;"Since it means nothing to you..."
5;47790;51760;"Gon's cry had guided 
Meleoron to the two boys."
6;132980;138030;"Insult x And x Payback"
7;144360;146830;"I'm going to have to refuse."
8;147530;149460;"Right now, I'm not in the mood."
9;149850;151830;"Come on, don't say that."
10;152540;155460;"Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!"
11;155940;159840;"Let me test my new technique on you."
12;166270;167910;"That hurts, man..."
13;167910;170220;"You don't have to give me such a dirty look."
14;170220;173980;"The one I really want to fight 
is someone else, you know."
15;174650;176910;"That guy with sunglasses, 
carrying the big pipe."
16;176910;179360;"Aren't you with him?"
17;180380;184710;"Then, why don't you go and find him?"
18;185520;187310;"I know where he is."
19;187310;188780;"But I can't get to him."
20;188780;192250;"He controls smoke, and he's hidden 
himself behind a smokescreen."
21;192720;195750;"{\fad(1,806)}And I can't get through."
22;196360;200010;"I climbed up to the roof, to see 
if I could get in from above..."
23;202290;204740;"And I happened to spot you."
24;207280;212770;"So I'm supposed to be the warm-up 
before your main fight?"
25;213420;215270;"Bingo!"
26;219880;221910;"I've had it for today..."
27;225390;227790;"Will you listen to what I have to say?"
28;228190;231950;"For the first time since taking 
over the family business,"
29;231950;235720;"I may have killed someone who wasn't my target."
30;235720;238630;"Dude, my technique is awesome!"
31;238630;241920;"Don't be too shocked when you see it."
32;241920;245550;"Well, you'll still be shocked in the end..."
33;247320;250040;"You're a self-centered fellow."
34;250960;254690;"Doesn't look like I'll be able to 
persuade you to let me go."
35;255200;257190;"Bingo and bingo!"
36;260350;263960;"You should watch your back."
37;266740;268000;"What an old trick!"
38;268000;269940;"I won't fall for that!"
39;269940;273960;"Your buddy told me to keep 
my eyes on my oppone—"
40;281900;286470;"Well, the result would have 
been the same either way."
41;300800;303030;"Should I have spared him?"
42;304410;305880;"Not necessary."
43;311390;312750;"How's Killua doing?"
44;313170;316020;"Hmm? He's matured."
45;316990;320710;"And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle."
46;321900;323050;"I see."
47;323930;326140;"Oh, that's right..."
48;326140;328920;"I had a rare experience today."
49;328920;332030;"My time was compressed!"
50;332600;335870;"I must remember to ignore 
half of everything you say."
51;344550;347390;"Okay, we should be safe here."
52;347390;348740;"Explain what's going on."
53;351110;353240;"God's Accomplice... Undo!"
54;353970;358500;"Shoot's out of the battle, 
and Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone."
55;358870;360380;"I need your help..."
56;360660;365120;"Knuckle's going to keep running, 
to try and buy time."
57;365120;366630;"He's crazy!"
58;366960;371390;"Okay, what's the minimum length of time 
you can maintain God's Accomplice?"
59;371580;376120;"The first time, I was so nervous, I failed 
and had to tap out after ten seconds."
60;376120;378010;"But I've regained my cool."
61;378010;380990;"If I don't move, I can hold my 
breath for at least a minute!"
62;380990;381980;"That's plenty of time."
63;382600;385070;"I just need one chance."
64;388510;393070;"Approximately three minutes 
before Killua raised his finger..."
65;397250;399320;"Knuckle was airborne."
66;402780;407550;"In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest 
point was his ability to run away."
67;418850;420680;"Once, to help his friends escape,"
68;420680;422590;"he knocked out a cop,"
69;422590;429170;"and eluded four patrol cars and dozens 
of police for a full day and night, on foot."
70;429560;432050;"The day he finally escaped was the day"
71;433020;435250;"he graduated from grade school."
72;443740;447710;"His stamina when maintaining top speed"
73;447710;450510;"far exceeds that of a cheetah."
74;451940;454760;"To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen"
75;454760;459580;"to reveal himself and use an out-boxing 
strategy against Youpi."
76;459580;461220;"For the most part, it was the right choice."
77;466370;467650;"He stopped chasing me?"
78;469150;473280;"If there was one thing he miscalculated, 
it was his opponent's intentions."
79;474720;477030;"Shoot's in trouble! Crap!"
80;480240;485340;"Shoot and Knuckle considered 
Youpi a high-priority target."
81;486020;489300;"But Youpi wasn't as focused on them."
82;490150;493570;"As a Royal Guard, protecting the 
King was his mission."
83;493570;497810;"His focus was on keeping enemies from the King."
84;499230;503930;"Youpi still believed the King 
to be in the throne room."
85;503930;507520;"And since guarding the stairway 
was his assignment,"
86;507930;514100;"he was convinced that Pitou and 
Pouf were protecting the King."
87;514660;521240;"So his main priority was to keep enemies 
away from the throne room."
88;521240;524020;"Since he didn't know how 
many enemies there were,"
89;524410;528110;"the nature of his opponent's 
ability took second priority."
90;528830;531630;"As did any enemies running or dying."
91;531960;534680;"They did not warrant his concern."
92;535420;537680;"Hey! Pitou!"
93;552950;554300;"Shoot!"
94;555310;557200;"Shoot was still alive."
95;561480;562800;"Shoot..."
96;568890;573460;"Given their positions, when Youpi turned back,"
97;573780;575190;"he must have spotted Shoot."
98;583040;585580;"Then we aren't even worth..."
99;586620;588660;"finishing off?"
100;590280;594790;"Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died."
101;595420;599490;"After having fought him with all they had,"
102;599490;601990;"the pair had never felt so humiliated."
103;604530;606390;"Are Shoot"
104;607490;609110;"and I"
105;609880;612460;"no more than flies?!"
106;613020;614760;"Fine, then!"
107;614760;617490;"You're gonna regret this!"
108;617490;623510;"In a few more minutes, 
this fly will send you flying!"
109;625570;628020;"Pitou! Pouf!"
110;628880;631080;"Are you there?"
111;632950;636050;"The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room."
112;636700;639280;"That means he and Pouf are alone inside."
113;640070;642410;"The King isn't in the throne room!"
114;643770;647290;"Say something! Can't you hear me?"
115;647290;648290;"Hey!"
116;650510;652150;"You fool..."
117;652150;654720;"You're free to defend an empty throne room!"
118;656350;661380;"I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance."
119;665380;667950;"Damn it..."
120;674370;677330;"By the time Knuckle realized his mistake,"
121;677330;680560;"he had already made another."
122;683580;686280;"Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another."
123;687690;691530;"Shoot must have been prepared 
to die at that moment."
124;693980;696910;"That's the kind of fight we came for."
125;698220;702530;"But he ignored Shoot..."
126;704980;708350;"When Knuckle pictured the 
expression on Youpi's face"
127;708350;712290;"after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot 
and headed up to the third floor,"
128;712980;717280;"Knuckle realized his new mistake."
129;719420;720780;"Damn it."
130;722250;724130;"Damn it..."
131;724690;728990;"Am I supposed to ignore the fact 
that my buddy's been humiliated?"
132;729580;730970;"For what reason?"
133;734090;735630;"For the world?"
134;736440;737830;"For humanity?"
135;739380;744380;"And if our mission succeeds, 
I just shake Shoot's hand and say,"
136;745080;746540;""We did it"?"
137;747700;750650;"Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?"
138;751120;754140;"Even though he was humiliated?"
139;754700;756850;"I can't do that!"
140;759000;760710;"That isn't right..."
141;767480;772410;"C-Come on..."
142;773500;774670;"Oh, sorry."
143;775170;780170;"And while I'm apologizing, I need 
you to wait here a little longer!"
144;780900;786140;"I need to punch that guy in the face..."
145;787540;793530;"And I'll throw another punch for you!"
146;798030;803380;"It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle..."
147;804960;806480;""Have you lost your mind?"
148;807000;808190;"Don't go."
149;808750;811920;"Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time.""
150;812650;815310;"That is my..."
151;819520;821440;"Do it, Knuckle!"
152;822860;824710;"Damn it!"
153;825050;826270;"That bastard..."
154;826850;827960;"He..."
155;828930;829970;"He..."
156;830780;833290;"looked at me like I was trash!"
157;834470;838280;"Give that bastard an extra punch for me..."
158;842510;844740;"Yeah, I got it!"
159;846790;849310;"Sorry, master..."
160;850340;852240;"We're both fools."
161;854590;857670;"There's something more important 
than the world right now!"
162;859990;861580;"Knuckle's new mistake"
163;862710;865070;"was a misjudgment of his priorities."
164;880090;883160;"My attacks aren't having any 
effect on this smoke..."
165;884400;885980;"Your Majesty!"
166;886850;889250;"Pitou! Pouf!"
167;889840;892280;"Are you there? Hey!"
168;893740;895380;"Is that Youpi?"
169;896610;898760;"Were they both defeated?"
170;900390;902650;"I hope the old man's doing okay..."
171;905090;908260;"Why isn't Pouf responding?"
172;909850;910920;"Something's wrong."
173;911510;915690;"Why is he staying inside his cocoon?"
174;916480;921350;"I would have expected him to be in 
more of a hurry to get to the King."
175;922720;926000;"Could we have made..."
176;926970;929420;"some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?"
177;930620;935250;"Is our operation actually working?"
178;937960;938830;"Don't think about it!"
179;939600;941960;"I'm here to fulfill my mission!"
180;944900;948730;"Doubt, worry, impatience..."
181;950450;955030;"Negative emotions are growing, 
but his resolve has not faltered."
182;956240;958650;"Just as I would expect from a strong fighter."
183;959260;960750;"I'm impressed."
184;962230;967360;"However, that will be the constraint 
that weakens your decision-making."
185;970320;971360;"Damn..."
186;972440;975240;"<i>Why is Pitou's</i> En <i>gone?</i>"
187;976200;980600;"Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?"
188;980600;982280;"Leaving me behind?"
189;983870;985630;"What happened?"
190;986230;988000;"What's going on?"
191;988380;989450;"It's time."
192;989920;991390;"Adding interest."
193;992420;993380;"Shut up!"
194;995860;998390;"The black fog on my shoulder won't go away."
195;998910;1001640;"And the number on this thing keeps increasing."
196;1002040;1004090;"I have to find the King!"
197;1005040;1008150;"Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs."
198;1008450;1011010;"That might have gotten rid of this fog."
199;1012180;1015160;"But I have to find the King!"
200;1015830;1017410;"What's going on?!"
201;1017800;1019410;"I'm getting annoyed!"
202;1029230;1030440;"Yo."
203;1041390;1047440;"What the hell is wrong with all of you?!"
204;1052310;1055450;"And with that shout, Youpi transformed."
205;1057110;1060840;"It was drastic enough to make Knuckle, 
who thought he had come prepared,"
206;1060840;1064960;"instantly switch from an offensive 
stance to an evasive one."
207;1065790;1069730;"This manifestation of evil"
208;1070590;1073800;"clearly meant only to destroy."
209;1110430;1111670;"Hang on!"
210;1112470;1113650;"Did you..."
211;1114120;1115420;"hit him?"
212;1115700;1116700;"Eh?"
213;1117430;1119840;"Did you hit him..."
214;1120440;1121550;"for me?"
215;1121810;1123610;"Not yet, damn it!"
216;1124090;1126280;"I'll hit him hard, so hold on!"
217;1126740;1130270;"But we have to run, so we don't die first!"
218;1147370;1150170;"For the first time in his life,"
219;1150170;1153130;"Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress."
220;1153500;1156640;"This had made it apparent that"
221;1156640;1160210;"his power was not meant for guarding the King."
222;1161400;1163720;"Rather, he realized that his violent rage"
223;1164100;1169500;"could fuel a rapid increase in the 
mass of both his body and his aura."
224;1171340;1174700;"The destruction brought him great pleasure,"
225;1174700;1181040;"after which his body rapidly shrank, 
and he felt a strong sense of loss."
226;1184090;1189870;"Knuckle's superior experience helped him 
understand what had happened to Youpi."
227;1191100;1192370;"We can win."
228;1193720;1195600;"That was a powerful blast."
229;1197070;1201560;"I doubt it'll be easy to goad him 
into doing that on purpose,"
230;1201560;1203980;"and make it out unharmed."
231;1204800;1209040;"But the return for taking that risk"
232;1209040;1211110;"will be enormous."
233;1213360;1215400;"I make him mad, so he blows up."
234;1216630;1219210;"The perfect time to hit him"
235;1219210;1222270;"would be when he's charging up."
236;1222270;1224910;"And the aura required to fuel his explosion"
237;1225480;1228550;"will cause him to go bankrupt sooner."
238;1230720;1234230;"The plan Knuckle formed on the spot"
239;1234230;1239170;"was almost flawless for dealing 
with the berserk Youpi."
240;1239720;1244300;"However, Youpi's true worth only 
became clear after the explosion."
241;1245730;1249100;"As Youpi transitioned between 
lingering pleasure and despondency,"
242;1249700;1253480;"this selfish ability that could be 
called the dregs of his ego"
243;1253900;1257480;"was focused solely on how he could use"
244;1258170;1261180;"this power for the King's sake."
245;1263040;1264440;"Selflessness..."
246;1265780;1269230;"His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality"
247;1269230;1274540;"continued to function calmly even after 
the discovery of his burst of emotion."
248;1276190;1279050;"My contribution to the King will be"
249;1279050;1285010;"how well I can control this ability 
without letting my emotions take over."
250;1286160;1287510;"In other words,"
251;1288620;1292260;"I must use it to destroy the intruders."
252;1294260;1298510;"Now that Youpi had learned how 
to be both enraged and composed,"
253;1299060;1302590;"the risk for Knuckle was overly great."
254;1305010;1308300;"Approximately three minutes have 
passed since the mission began."
255;1317090;1320610;"The intentions of all involved
are beginning to come together."
256;1404940;1407210;"Next time: A x False x Rage."
257;1407210;1409060;"Yeah, screw you!"
258;1409060;1410320;"Sorry, Killua..."
259;1410320;1411780;"I won't forgive you."
260;1411780;1413310;"Here's a chocolate robot."
261;1413310;1414260;"Gon!"
