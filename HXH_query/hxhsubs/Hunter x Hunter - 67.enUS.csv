change those faces,"
77;321010;322170;"so it's ninety-two."
78;322750;326310;"The important thing is that we took 
the cards they were monopolizing."
79;326310;330300;"And for two of the others, we're just 
waiting for someone to use Gain on them."
80;330300;332680;"The biggest obstacle is #2."

84;341870;344320;"Then we'll make for 
Soufrabi, to find #2."
85;344950;349020;"For #75, we simply need to find 
someone with it, then take it."

105;410680;412140;"Yeah, that's why..."
106;415690;416640;"I get it..."
107;417060;417750;"Huh?"
108;418080;421600;"If you guys got to Masadora, 
but there weren't any Leave cards,"
109;421600;422650;"what would you do?"
110;423050;424380;"Well..."
111;424750;428150;"I'd save money until a Leave showed up."
112;428500;429340;"Yeah."
113;429340;431010;"Okay, then what if"
114;431010;433880;"you acquired a super rare

able to trade for a Leave—"
120;451630;452330;"See?"
121;460710;461810;"Need a Leave?"
122;463350;466270;"Want to go back to the real world?"
123;477790;481330;"We've gotten four restricted 
slot cards for three Leaves."
124;481780;484710;"Okay, that makes a total 
of fifty-four types."
125;485060;486720;"Score!"
126;489100;493900;"So the cards that wouldn't fit in 
our binders reverted to items."
127;494410;497070;"We're running out of free pockets."

138;523570;527680;"We've been deliberately 
avoiding other players,"
139;527680;532660;"but we'll have to take risks 
to obtain the rarer cards."
140;532660;533630;"Yeah."
141;533990;537140;"Well, let's get what we can ourselves,"
142;537140;540390;"then negotiate aggressively
 with any players we come across."
143;540710;542040;"Sound good?"
144;542430;543190;"Yeah."
145;543190;544020;"Yep!"

around any of these guys."
153;565290;566610;"No kidding..."

remove curses, right?"

157;580390;582670;"Oh, so it won't work."
158;582670;584180;"Did you have an idea?"
159;584560;587710;"I was wondering if a curse 
was behind the disease"

were suffering from."

163;595860;598240;"The ones who took all your money."
164;598780;601560;"But it won't work since 
they aren't cards."
165;601560;602240;"No."
166;603340;605110;"It's worth a shot."

the numbers of their cards."
216;738840;742940;"But getting a player's name from 
the ranking still won't let you"

219;748220;751740;"Don't you feel smarter now, boys?"
220;753570;756690;"In other words, if we know 
the members of a team,"
221;756690;759900;"we can determine how 
many cards they have."
222;760160;763680;"And Team Genthru is only missing #0,"
223;763680;766370;"#2, #9, and #75."

225;769040;771800;"There's a solid theory that #0 appears"
226;771800;774910;"in an event after the other 
ninety-nine are collected,"
227;774910;776250;"so they only need three."
228;776550;780830;"We propose to find one of those 
three types before they do"
229;780830;784760;"and monopolize it, to prevent 
them from clearing the game."
230;785030;786490;"There's gotta be something else."
231;786490;789890;"We could deluge them with spell cards."
232;790190;793150;"They already have a Paladin's Necklace."

263;876930;880480;"We have one of the three 
cards they're missing."
264;881870;883180;"Still dissatisfied?"
265;884110;885810;"No, that's good enough."
266;886310;889030;"So tell us what their abilities are."
267;889030;890000;"What about you?"
268;890830;894620;"Show us some proof you 
can be useful to us."
269;894620;897610;"We have seventy-one types 
of restricted slot cards..."
270;898120;900100;"Significantly more than you."
271;900770;905130;"I'll give you an A-rank card in 
return for the information."
272;905610;907380;"You shouldn't have a problem with that."
273;907380;908870;"I have a problem."
274;908870;911390;"We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves."
275;912130;915880;"So give us two S-rank cards or 
equally valuable information."
276;915880;917450;"Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing."
277;917450;919640;"Don't get too cocky, brat!"
278;920050;921710;"Did you hear that, everyone?"
279;921710;923410;"These kids won't be any help."
280;923800;926260;"They want two S-rank 
cards from each team."
281;926260;928030;"That's ten cards they'd take."
282;928210;929550;"Don't be a fool."
283;929550;931060;"I'm only taking cards from your team."
284;931060;931800;"Huh?"
285;932560;934700;"I'm fine with giving information 
to the other four."
286;935200;937660;"I'll let them decide 
what to offer in return."
287;937940;941650;"But I won't tell you anything 
until you meet my condition."
288;943050;944780;"You are a stupid brat..."
289;944780;946670;"Throwing a tantrum because 
I didn't baby you, huh?"
290;946670;948600;"Stop this, both of you..."
291;948600;950550;"We don't have time to 
fight amongst ourselves!"
292;950790;953300;"I haven't agreed to 
team up with them yet!"
293;953460;955130;"It's fine, Asta..."
294;955130;956470;"Give them two cards."
295;956470;958310;"We need to move on."
296;958410;959490;"What?!"
297;959490;962620;"I have no problem with 
giving them cards!"
298;962620;964310;"But that kid's trying to pick a fight!"
299;964680;966210;"You're the one picking a fight!"
300;966650;968390;"Hey, let's leave."
301;968720;970590;"I don't want to team 
up with these people!"
302;970590;973050;"Come, now... 
Though I admit I'm a bit peeved."
303;973050;974830;"But given the circumstances..."
304;978790;984260;"Genthru has these two abilities, 
Countdown and Little Flower."
305;984610;987840;"So it's best to keep 
your distance from him."
306;988170;990340;"Seriously? He got me..."
307;990340;991500;"Same here."
308;991500;993240;"He touched me when we 
were making a deal."
309;993240;994590;"Me, too..."
310;994810;997760;"Sounds like a bunch of 
them might be victims."
311;997760;998720;"A chance!"
312;998970;1001410;"Isn't there any way to 
disable his technique?"
313;1001410;1002900;"Yep, there is..."
314;1002900;1006270;"You have to touch Genthru and say, 
"I caught the Bomber.""
315;1006580;1008780;"Stupid! Why did you tell them?"
316;1008780;1011120;"We could've gotten more 
cards out of them!"
317;1011120;1013490;"That would have started another fight."
318;1014160;1018120;"The bombs can't be armed until Genthru 
explains how his ability works,"
319;1018120;1019990;"so if you keep away from him,"
320;1019990;1021660;"you should be safe."
321;1024480;1028000;"Did you know there are 
two ways to cast spells?"
322;1028330;1029470;"Yep, I did."
323;1029830;1034130;"A spell card is used up the
 moment you say its name aloud."
324;1034420;1036760;"But it's possible to 
keep reusing a spell."
325;1036760;1037570;"Huh?"
326;1038490;1041230;"For example, you know how a list"
327;1041230;1044140;"of players you've met appears if 
you put Steal in your binder?"
328;1044450;1047500;"If you remove the card without 
pressing the select button,"
329;1048050;1052770;"the spell card isn't used up, 
so you can keep reusing it."
330;1053110;1054910;"I never tried that."
331;1054910;1055530;"Yeah."
332;1057480;1060660;"You can buy all B-rank 
restricted slot cards at stores."
333;1061120;1064480;"You simply need to buy from the 
same Trade Shop over fifty times."
334;1065130;1068590;"If you become a frequent customer, 
they'll start making you offers."
335;1069990;1071900;"Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?"
336;1072410;1075040;"Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?"
337;1076990;1078550;"Is that enough information"
338;1078910;1080550;"to satisfy you?"
339;1081180;1083400;"I'll give you another 
card if you're not happy."
340;1083400;1085500;"Nope, that's enough, thanks!"
341;1085500;1087560;"I'm up next, then."
342;1088290;1089490;"I'm Goreinu."
343;1089490;1090560;"Nice to meet you."
344;1093000;1094810;"Thanks, everyone!"
345;1094810;1096530;"That was very educational."
346;1096830;1100030;"The question now is which card 
we should try to monopolize."
347;1100500;1104650;"It's probably impossible to 
monopolize the #75 we have."
348;1105350;1109210;"Each team can only obtain one, 
and the limit is twenty,"
349;1109620;1111200;"which is too high."
350;1111200;1113320;"You obtained #75?"
351;1113320;1114960;"That's impressive."
352;1115230;1116220;"List on!"
353;1116220;1117700;"#75."
354;1118470;1123470;"Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite. 
Currently, 6 cards are in play."
355;1121330;1123470;"So five other teams each have one."
356;1123830;1125790;"Monopolizing this one 
will be impossible."
357;1125790;1127230;"What about the other two?"
358;1127230;1128140;"List on!"
359;1128140;1128910;"#9!"
360;1129350;1130260;"List on."
361;1130260;1131240;"#2."
362;1131950;1132950;"No good."
363;1132950;1135180;"There are three teams with #9."
364;1135460;1138320;"No one has #2, Patch of Shore..."
365;1139190;1140740;"We can make it work!"
366;1141030;1142010;"Guide Post On."
367;1142010;1142780;"#2."
368;1144050;1145250;"I know where to find it..."
369;1145740;1146750;"Soufrabi."
370;1146750;1148150;"I've been there before!"
371;1148150;1149800;"I have an Accompany card here."
372;1149800;1151500;"Okay, let's go."
373;1151500;1152620;"Accompany on!"
374;1152620;1153590;"To Soufrabi!"
375;1159380;1161260;"This is Soufrabi?"
376;1161260;1163400;"It's a pretty big city..."
377;1163280;1167270;"{\fad(508,479)}Soufrabi"
378;1163920;1165740;"Let's head in and snoop around."
379;1169960;1172230;"Search every room, one by one."
380;1172230;1174400;"Some characters may not 
give you information"
381;1174400;1177810;"until you visit multiple 
times, so pay attention."
382;1177810;1178970;"Okay!"
383;1178970;1179900;"Hey!"
384;1180350;1182550;"I found someone with information."
385;1182550;1183660;"Fast!"
386;1186790;1190160;"The pirates rule this city..."
387;1190650;1192690;"There's a legend about 
an underwater cavern"
388;1192690;1197670;"called the Sea God's Grotto 
located somewhere in this area."
389;1198610;1201680;"Patch of Shore is the entrance to it."
390;1202240;1207520;"A few years ago, having heard of the 
legendary cavern and its treasure,"
391;1207520;1211690;"fifteen pirates arrived in this city."
392;1212950;1215690;"Razor and the fourteen devils..."
393;1216210;1219710;"The city fishermen were 
all tortured and killed."
394;1222950;1226490;"The pirates murdered anyone who 
knew about Patch of Shore."
395;1228940;1232990;"If you get rid of the pirates, 
I'll tell you what I know."
396;1235130;1239980;"When we visited a few months earlier, 
we couldn't find a single clue."
397;1240660;1243200;"This must be information only 
available at certain times."
398;1243200;1245840;"Maybe an event that only 
occurs at this time frame?"
399;1246840;1249520;"Razor and the fourteen devils..."
400;1250130;1251830;"It's possible that the event"
401;1251830;1254210;"was triggered by the 
number of players here."
402;1254210;1255020;"Huh?"
403;1255310;1256920;"There are fifteen pirates."
404;1256920;1259220;"And it just so happens that 
there are fifteen of us."
405;1259850;1264280;"So the event won't start until you 
have a party of fifteen or more?"
406;1264620;1267760;"But how would a game 
character know that?"
407;1267760;1269790;"Oh, Accompany!"
408;1269790;1274180;"Yes, a group of fifteen or more must 
reach Soufrabi with Accompany."
409;1274570;1277420;"That's probably the 
trigger for this event."
410;1278480;1279880;"Brutal..."
411;1279880;1280400;"Huh?"
412;1280400;1281530;"Oh, nothing."
413;1283310;1285580;"Let's go to the pirate's base!"
414;1299360;1303190;"Gon and his friends stand before 
some unpleasant looking pirates."
415;1303640;1309510;"Will the fifteen allies be able 
to obtain Patch of Shore?"
416;1381190;1388300;"G.I. Tutorial"
417;1381840;1384900;"Coming up, it's the 
Greed Island Tutorial!"
418;1387130;1390100;"Today, we introduce the card 
Tax Collector's Gauntlet."
419;1388280;1398830;"Tax Collector's Gauntlet 

When equipped, player has 
the ability to cast Levy. But 
each cast will destroy a random 
card from player's restricted 
slots. (Cannot use Levy if 
restricted slots are empty.)"
420;1390210;1392970;"If you turn this card into 
an item and equip it,"
421;1392970;1394880;"you can steal random cards from others."
422;1394880;1396580;"And you can keep reusing it!"
423;1397660;1398460;"Clunk."
424;1399150;1400970;"Continue!"
425;1405500;1407960;"Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses."
426;1409680;1410450;"Go!"
427;1413170;1414050;"I can't say that!"
