3;142030;146820;"The moment Killua entered the palace..."
4;146820;148020;"I knew it!"
5;148400;149490;"...was his reaction."
6;151190;153700;"He couldn't sense Pitou's <i>En</i> at all,"
7;154100;160010;"and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had 
expected to encounter on the first floor."
8;161210;163070;"Despite the fact that they were now"
9;163070;166390;"in a situation that was utterly 
unforeseen in their planning,"
10;167120;171020;"Killua's experience helped him stay calm."
11;174090;175860;"Who are these guys?"
12;175860;177530;"Where did they come from?"
13;178490;182530;"From Youpi's perspective, too, 
his current situation was an impossibility."
14;182780;185720;"Youpi immediately ceased all thought."
15;215950;217680;"I am a shield."
16;218030;221200;"I protect the King with my body."
17;221770;227140;"Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was 
created from Magical Beasts, not humans."
18;227660;229450;"Perhaps that was why"
19;229450;233010;"he lacked the self-preservative 
nature of the other two Royal Guard."
20;233010;235710;"However, that lack also gave him strength."
21;241770;246160;"The moment Youpi changed 
forms with a belligerent smile,"
22;246160;248180;"Shoot froze at once."
23;253970;258980;"However, it wasn't because 
Shoot was slow to react."
24;259750;263990;"If I move any closer, he will attack."
25;265140;270740;"And if his attack happens to connect with 
the invisible Knuckle and Meleoron..."
26;273790;277500;"In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself,"
27;277840;281270;"he began to move his cage and floating arms..."
28;282260;283620;"And then it happened."
29;298430;300870;"This is Dragon Dive!"
30;303270;305320;"Then the old man's friend is..."
31;305960;308680;"Only Killua understood what was happening,"
32;308680;310590;"and it momentarily froze him."
33;311670;315390;"The shock was even greater to those 
who didn't know what was going on."
34;316830;319660;"There were only two present,"
35;323200;326840;"Gon and Youpi, who remained focused 
on the enemy that faced them."
36;327580;328340;"No way!"
37;328930;330100;"Has he lost it?"
38;330630;333120;"You aren't supposed to fight Youpi..."
39;333710;336120;"No, wait."
40;343480;345810;"Realization came a moment later to Killua,"
41;345810;349900;"and still a few moments later to the others."
42;351820;355820;"Seriously, even in this situation,"
43;355820;359380;"how did he realize that, and so quickly?"
44;360480;366910;"If Meleoron and Knuckle were to 
be pierced by a Dragon Lance"
45;366910;371470;"while God's Accomplice was 
active, and die instantly,"
46;372170;374390;"would their invisibility cease?"
47;375390;382350;"Or would the <i>Nen</i> remain, leaving them to 
decompose without anyone ever knowing?"
48;382780;384650;"No one knew the answer."
49;385580;391620;"Assuming the latter, confirming whether they 
were still alive would be impossible."
50;392780;396420;"Meaning that, in the worst-case 
scenario, someone else would"
51;396420;398660;"have to deal with Youpi."
52;400600;402920;"That should have been my job..."
53;404680;405670;"Gon!"
54;406520;408170;"Shoot did nothing wrong."
55;408770;412350;"Even I was later than Killua 
in noticing and reacting."
56;415100;417430;"Shoot, don't blame yourself..."
57;418040;419790;"Pull yourself together!"
58;420330;422190;"If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi,"
59;422780;424380;"you're left with Pitou!"
60;427980;429340;"However,"
61;429340;434400;"Shoot was feeling a completely 
different emotion at that moment."
62;436550;437660;"Gon!"
63;438390;441340;"I want to tell the entire world..."
64;442100;443820;""This is Gon!"
65;445580;448290;"A boy less than half my age,"
66;449270;451060;"to whom I owe my life.""
67;452980;457580;"I've always gone to any lengths 
to avoid facing danger and risk,"
68;457580;464320;"hiding myself within a safe cage, 
where no one could hurt me."
69;466510;468980;"I hated myself for it..."
70;469810;471870;"But I couldn't change myself."
71;472980;477080;"Friends and teachers encouraged me,"
72;477080;480730;"but I never truly listened, 
considering it the logic of the strong."
73;481550;483500;"Yet somehow..."
74;486500;489840;"A boy with less than half my strength"
75;491880;494470;"managed to break my cage!"
76;497890;502640;"Shoot did indeed tend to shrink 
back weakly from opportunity."
77;504040;505650;"I will survive..."
78;506870;508400;"So that I can thank you!"
79;509140;511320;"However, even he didn't realize that"
80;511320;517460;"such unique turns in his train of thought 
made him shine in the face of adversity."
81;520100;521140;"Good!"
82;551190;552540;"Knuckle and Meleoron..."
83;553090;553940;"...are alive!"
84;579590;580700;"What?"
85;584520;587550;"Who was it that just attacked me?"
86;590980;592440;"I couldn't see a thing..."
87;593040;595580;"Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?"
88;604790;607300;"Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!"
89;608370;612930;"Naturally, they had already tested 
to confirm that God's Accomplice"
90;612930;615770;"would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."
91;616620;622310;"As long as God's Accomplice stayed active, 
Youpi would be unable to see APR."
92;622760;625870;"Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question"
93;625870;630880;"what had just happened, rather than 
concentrate on the enemies before him."
94;632780;634730;"I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect."
95;635400;637990;"Which means my focus right now should be..."
96;649470;653140;"So far, everything had proceeded 
according to the Hunters' plan."
97;653910;660130;"However, after a successful first strike, 
Knuckle could only shudder."
98;662190;663640;"Seriously?"
99;666690;668600;"It's like his aura is unlimited!"
100;677040;680510;"After surviving over five thousand battles,"
101;680510;683980;"Knuckle had the experience and intuition 
to quantify his opponent's strength."
102;684790;688620;"It was not uncommon for him to 
face enemies who were stronger"
103;688620;690550;"than previous opponents he had encountered."
104;694160;698270;"However, there was no comparing 
the power he now faced"
105;698270;702570;"to that of the opponents who had come before."
106;703990;707930;"A monster with an immense amount of aura."
107;711790;713110;"Five times what the boss has?"
108;713740;714570;"Ten times?"
109;715420;716520;"More?"
110;718070;719550;"I can't tell!"
111;720350;722750;"He had never experienced anything like this."
112;732750;735940;"Assuming he's ten times stronger,"
113;737230;739620;"with 700,000 aura,"
114;741500;743740;"how long will it take before he goes bust?"
115;753480;754270;"The King!"
116;758110;759140;"That was when"
117;761600;763740;"the Hunters felt"
118;764930;767490;"the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura."
119;768800;772540;"Youpi immediately noticed 
that momentary hesitation."
120;774080;777030;"Your Majesty!"
121;788880;790680;"Your Majesty!"
122;809790;812340;"Since Pitou lacked wings,"
123;812340;816010;"the only option was to continue free falling."
124;816460;818570;"This was actually a stroke of luck."
125;819560;821720;"Had there been unlimited courses of action,"
126;821720;826710;"Pitou would have joined Pouf and 
rushed straight toward the King,"
127;826710;829430;"a Royal Guard's natural reaction."
128;829910;833220;"In that scenario, it's unlikely 
that Pitou would have had"
129;833220;835040;"the presence of mind to use <i>En</i>."
130;836850;837870;"As a result..."
131;848550;851080;"The guest room on the second 
floor of the west tower..."
132;853390;856460;"The King is with the woman with closed eyes."
133;872300;874950;"<i>They're also using</i> En <i>to locate the King!</i>"
134;875860;882660;"This was when Pitou realized the 
seriousness of the situation."
135;883570;888300;"In that instant, Pitou crouched like the 
four-legged creature of the Ant's origin,"
136;888780;890950;"with upper legs tensing like steel"
137;890950;896470;"until they were twice as large as they'd 
been before the attack on Kite."
138;914540;916320;"In order to reach the King"
139;917140;919190;"before the enemy could."
140;922070;923900;"But a second later..."
141;933170;938430;"A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination"
142;938700;942960;"was strong enough to make 
Pitou regret the decision."
143;945320;946540;"This is..."
144;946930;947950;"the King's..."
145;950000;952450;"The aura coming from the King"
146;952450;956930;"was so unmasked, his current state 
of mind was plain to read."
147;957580;960620;"As a result, Pitou could only conclude"
148;960620;966590;"that the situation had grown 
even worse than previously thought."
149;1021520;1024500;"The main stairway had collapsed!"
150;1080350;1085180;"When the King looked down, 
time began to move again."
151;1085830;1089820;"However, time remained frozen for everyone else."
152;1097060;1100630;"The intruders, who had come for the King's life,"
153;1101200;1104200;"were holding their breath and standing still"
154;1105380;1107210;"because of the girl covered in blood."
155;1108150;1112960;"And because the grotesque 
creature holding her body"
156;1113420;1118440;"was clearly treating her with tenderness and care."
157;1138500;1139490;"Pitou."
158;1139690;1141490;"Y-Yes, sir."
159;1142840;1146030;"The expression on the King's face 
had returned to normal."
160;1146480;1149850;"This only increased Pitou's concern."
161;1152710;1154500;"Heal Komugi."
162;1155530;1156700;"I'm counting on you."
163;1183080;1187760;"The two veterans continued to stand by,"
164;1187760;1190720;"silently watching their enemies,"
165;1190720;1192480;"out of respect."
166;1199820;1204120;"This was an act of love for a life."
167;1208900;1212580;"Should they infringe upon that act, 
their cause was lost."
168;1212930;1214670;"It would have been inhumane."
169;1221030;1224580;"This isn't what I was given to expect."
170;1225050;1228110;"For Zeno to make that comment was only natural."
171;1228670;1231960;"Netero felt the same way."
172;1237100;1238590;"Not here."
173;1241690;1243260;"Let us go elsewhere."
174;1244210;1246510;"I believe that a different location"
175;1248400;1250440;"would be to your benefit, as well."
176;1252220;1257360;"Netero had spent a great deal of money 
to enlist Zeno to help separate"
177;1257360;1259880;"the King from the Royal Guard."
178;1260450;1262250;"He had no reason to object to the King's proposal."
179;1262980;1264110;"However..."
180;1265120;1267040;"Well, I suppose."
181;1267850;1271890;"He could not help but feel 
he had lost the initiative..."
182;1278010;1279540;"Doctor Blythe."
183;1283710;1286890;"The moment Pitou's ability was activated,"
184;1293700;1296680;"the two men thought that their decision"
185;1296680;1299550;"to lower their guard would prove fatal."
186;1305400;1312360;"Because the King was able to walk 
between them with ease."
187;1316160;1319910;"Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster."
188;1404520;1406920;"Next time: An x Indebted x Insect."
189;1406920;1409070;"Gon, what are you eating?"
190;1409070;1411530;"Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects."
191;1411530;1413850;"I-Insects that are candy?"
