9;115960;120700;"Colt arrived, under a white flag of 
surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor."
10;121130;125470;"His wish was that they save the dying Queen."
11;126000;131150;"After hearing his request, Morel and 
Knov took Colt to see Netero."
12;132740;133930;"It's me."
13;133930;138420;"Send over a team of Chimera Ant 
researchers immediately."
14;139870;140760;"Hmm?"
15;141220;142660;"The king has been born."
16;143790;146710;"Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,"
17;146710;149320;"and have him bring all"
18;149320;153260;"his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts."
19;157860;160200;"We leave in four hours."
20;160200;161130;"Yes, sir."
21;169950;173490;"We will do everything we can."
22;175280;176370;"Colt-kun..."
23;178410;181320;"We'll need your cooperation."
24;188750;193080;"Heart"
25;189760;192770;"This may be the last time I wear this..."
26;193080;195250;"Hey, is that..."
27;195250;198340;"Yes, it's his "heart" T-shirt."
28;198340;202510;"Heart"
29;198980;203980;"They say it's a lucky shirt he only 
wears when he fights for real."
30;205890;208180;"But I always thought it was a just a rumor..."
31;208920;213240;"Colt-kun, it appears that you can use <i>Nen</i>..."
32;219300;223010;"Since you've been in the King's presence,"
33;223010;225950;"I want you to give me your honest opinion."
34;227280;230830;"How do I compare to the King?"
35;231870;233430;"He really is special..."
36;233870;237860;"It feels like needles pricking 
me all over my body."
37;240720;241900;"Most likely,"
38;242680;245010;"you will be unable to lay a finger on him."
39;246330;248130;"You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard"
40;248660;250820;"before you can get close enough."
41;254650;255870;"I see..."
42;256600;258520;"I'm happy to hear that."
43;259420;262000;"At this age, I'll be a challenger."
44;262430;264580;"This is exciting stuff."
45;269150;273350;"Morel, I believe your disciples 
were to fight today, yes?"
46;273780;274720;"Yes."
47;274720;278100;"Take the victors and the research team,"
48;278100;280800;"along with Colt, to the nest."
49;281120;282220;"And you, Chairman?"
50;282220;284460;"You don't plan to pursue the King alone?"
51;284460;285550;"Oh, no..."
52;286170;289290;"I'm off to see an old acquaintance."
53;305060;307570;"Don't forget to pay me my one million."
54;307890;309630;"I know."
55;309630;311800;"What are you talking about?"
56;311800;313110;"Nothing important."
57;313610;314660;"Let's go."
58;314660;315680;"Yeah."
59;318680;321590;"Everyone else has left."
60;321940;326720;"Most of our soldiers joined 
other squadrons and left."
61;327250;332600;"Though a few oddballs did leave 
their squadrons to stay here."
62;332960;337140;"I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out."
63;340440;343070;"Did you stop the bleeding?"
64;343070;347360;"Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her."
65;347620;351620;"I'm not sure we can, either. 
Don't expect too much."
66;352150;355870;"For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs."
67;356600;358470;"Can you use my organs?"
68;358470;360630;"You can have all my blood, as well!"
69;362340;363920;"Unfortunately, it won't work."
70;364800;368630;"Chimera Ants from different generations 
are completely different organisms."
71;368970;374640;"Just look at how much the Chimera 
Ants in your own generation vary."
72;376190;378140;"But the sentiment is appreciated."
73;378370;380400;"We'll do our best, so pray..."
74;383150;387060;"That, miraculously, all the organs will function."
75;415030;416200;"Pray..."
76;416700;420040;"Is that all I can do?"
77;421950;423440;"Someone..."
78;425040;427060;"Is anyone there?"
79;428560;431060;"Yes, I am by your side!"
80;431060;433070;"Please give me your command!"
81;433070;434020;"What is it?"
82;434670;435690;"Telepathy?"
83;435690;436580;"Yes,"
84;436850;440430;"the Queen cannot speak as we do."
85;440430;441840;"Can you tell us what she's saying?"
86;442580;445590;"Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life."
87;447180;448620;"My son..."
88;449270;454090;"Is my son all right?"
89;455520;460400;"Did he have any defects?"
90;460400;461780;"...defects?"
91;466390;468670;"You have nothing to worry about."
92;468670;470610;"He is perfectly healthy, and right now..."
93;471030;475530;"And right now, he's taken 
the Royal Guard to search"
94;475530;476810;"for medicine to help you."
95;476810;478510;"...to help you."
96;480930;484390;"The truth is that, after he killed 
and ate Squadron Leaders,"
97;484390;487130;"he left in search of a new territory."
98;487130;489730;"I doubt he will return."
99;489730;491050;"He ate them?"
100;491050;491880;"The King"
101;492560;497000;"has no concern for the Queen's health!"
102;498440;502680;"Then, the King is safe?"
103;503280;504400;"Yes."
104;506270;507950;"That is wonderful..."
105;510400;511650;"Oh, no."
106;512300;516340;"Send the King off at once."
107;519780;525870;"There is no time to waste on my well-being..."
108;527670;533170;"My son has the potential to rule the world."
109;536430;538810;"He was born too early,"
110;539730;542460;"so I was very worried."
111;543480;546900;"However, it appears..."
112;547240;550040;"I have fulfilled my duty..."
113;556290;559530;"That was all I wanted."
114;559530;561160;"What are you saying?!"
115;561420;564590;"You are our guiding light..."
116;564590;568990;"Without you, the rest of us will 
lose our way and perish."
117;571680;578740;"I know my body better than anyone else..."
118;580530;584020;"I will not last much longer."
119;587630;591540;"However, I have"
120;592550;593760;"no regrets."
121;593760;595190;"Please stop!"
122;597050;599200;"I beg you... Please live!"
123;600010;602120;"Use my body! Please!"
124;602590;603590;"Give it a shot!"
125;603590;605700;"Until you try, you don't know it won't work!"
126;606760;607810;"Listen..."
127;608500;611710;"You must listen to what the Queen has to say."
128;614150;620570;"I have one last request..."
129;622440;625410;"I thought of a name..."
130;626420;627980;"for my son."
131;628730;631200;"For the King..."
132;632460;633550;"A name?"
133;636200;637930;"Meruem."
134;640230;645930;"It means the light that illuminates all."
135;649160;653840;"Deliver my message to him..."
136;657820;664180;"My beloved son..."
137;683210;686380;"I failed to protect her again..."
138;690120;694360;"I can't protect anyone..."
139;699120;701480;"Has something like this happened before?"
140;702390;705350;"No, he's probably referring to a memory"
141;705350;706810;"from when he was human."
142;707710;711160;"You have memories from 
when you were human?"
143;711160;715310;"Of course, though naturally, some 
remember more than others..."
144;715880;717670;"Our human personalities"
145;717670;720160;"strongly influence our current behavior."
146;721070;725070;"And many can remember their human names."
147;725690;729510;"Otherwise, it wouldn't have been 
as easy to learn to speak."
148;748270;748990;"Hmm?"
149;749740;751850;"Th-This is..."
150;755820;757020;"There's..."
151;758200;760180;"There's something moving!"
152;762390;763470;"Don't touch it!"
153;765090;766180;"I will..."
154;766860;768260;"I will remove it."
155;819210;822980;"I shall protect this child..."
156;824390;825430;"I swear it!"
157;826720;829470;"This time, I won't fail..."
158;845670;846720;"Morel?"
159;848000;849020;"Colt..."
160;849560;851330;"Can you promise me"
161;851770;854260;"that you and that child 
will never eat humans?"
162;859940;862650;"If you can't make that promise,"
163;863300;866950;"you should get out of my sight immediately."
164;868790;871850;"But if you're willing to give your word..."
165;876180;881330;"No one will ever lay a finger on you,"
166;881330;884110;"not as long as I'm around."
167;885740;887500;"You have my promise!"
168;894660;896620;"It isn't a big deal..."
169;896870;902140;"I inherited my soft nature from my master."
170;961250;963310;"Okay, I've recovered!"
171;963560;967250;"Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite."
172;967660;970570;"So I have to become stronger!"
173;971300;974820;"So that Kite won't be disappointed 
when he comes back."
174;976820;980330;"Ah, so you do understand."
175;981520;984010;"You may have met Kite before we did,"
176;984010;987560;"but we've spent more time with him."
177;989810;994340;"After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still 
been moping, I would've given you a beating..."
178;996040;999820;"And told you that Kite wouldn't 
want to see you two like this."
179;1001260;1003240;"I know he's still alive,"
180;1003710;1006860;"and he doesn't want you to have regrets."
181;1007870;1010000;"Right now, what should you do?"
182;1010760;1014520;"You must make the correct decision, 
and find the will to follow through!"
183;1015550;1017850;"If you're too weak, train more."
184;1017850;1021120;"There's enough space here 
for squats and push-ups."
185;1022250;1024070;"Yeah, you're right."
186;1028630;1030020;"Hey, Spin..."
187;1030480;1031380;"Hmm?"
188;1032380;1034430;"Why do you want to be a Hunter?"
189;1036410;1040260;"I need the money to repay a huge debt."
190;1043350;1045340;"Have you heard of the small-billed swan?"
191;1045340;1046270;"Nope..."
192;1047240;1050550;"It's a species of bird that can only live 
in the area around a certain mine."
193;1051210;1054420;"No one knows why that is."
194;1054780;1058280;"Is it the water? The food? The weather?"
195;1060260;1064090;"So I bought the entire area where the mine is."
196;1066030;1069690;"Well, the mine's closed down now."
197;1071490;1073870;"Kite provided the money for that."
198;1074200;1078570;"He was the first adult who was willing to listen"
199;1078570;1081920;"to kids who had nothing at all."
200;1085320;1089620;"Stinn and I were born in that area."
201;1099370;1104720;"The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking 
flight with the light of dawn at their backs..."
202;1105500;1112990;"That's the oldest, but strongest, 
memory Stinn and I have."
203;1116770;1120520;"When we heard the area would be demolished,"
204;1121220;1125060;"we realized how important it was to us..."
205;1126600;1129850;"Kite said that he envied us."
206;1131080;1133140;"He doesn't have a home."
207;1133140;1135860;"Because he doesn't know where he was born."
208;1139720;1144370;"Once this mission is over, 
I can show you two"
209;1146750;1148470;"my treasure."
210;1198490;1200760;"Th-This is..."
211;1222540;1224240;"Goal!"
212;1227070;1230540;"I am the Speed King."
213;1230940;1234250;"No one can stop me!"
214;1239430;1244490;"Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably 
already crossed the border."
215;1245960;1248800;"Well, I'll take my time searching..."
216;1250540;1255560;"For my own paradise, 
with plenty of food and females."
217;1256690;1261260;"Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears..."
218;1261880;1265000;"I'll take any of those if they're plentiful."
219;1265530;1269770;"Because I am the Glutton King."
220;1273250;1276390;"The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers"
221;1277400;1280760;"have now departed to become kings."
222;1295060;1297230;"Meanwhile, the King"
223;1298030;1301140;"is now in the Republic of East Gorteau."
224;1404640;1406830;"Next time: Date x With x Palm."
225;1406830;1408070;"A date! A date!"
226;1408070;1410370;"Gon, do you understand what a date is?"
227;1410370;1411400;"Huh? Sure."
228;1411400;1412960;"It's when a man and woman—"
229;1412960;1414450;"Th-Th-That's enough!"
