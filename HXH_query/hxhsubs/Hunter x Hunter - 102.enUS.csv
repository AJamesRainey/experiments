2;2710;8560;"After you told me, an octopus, 
that I was a cool guy..."
3;9420;11700;"After you said we could be friends..."
4;13260;15740;"I couldn't let you die!"
5;20030;21870;"I'm gonna save you!"
6;22110;25000;"Don't die on me!"
7;105000;110000;"Power x And x Games"
8;111470;115970;"While Killua was being rescued 
by the Chimera Ant Ikalgo,"
9;115970;118120;"his supposed enemy,"
10;118950;124990;"Gon, too, was forming a bond with 
a Chimera Ant called Meleoron."
11;134440;136850;"You should stop smoking."
12;138080;140760;"If the smoke sticks to you,"
13;140760;144280;"people can smell you coming, and it'll 
waste your ability to become invisible."
14;145360;147400;"I appreciate the warning."
15;147400;149750;"But honestly, that doesn't matter."
16;150010;153020;"While my invisibility is a sort of calling card,"
17;153020;155890;"my real power is on an entirely different level."
18;157940;159360;"Just watch."
19;165130;168650;"Huh?! He vanished in an instant..."
20;169890;171440;"I can't sense him at all."
21;172010;173770;"Only the smell of cigarettes."
22;176580;177600;"He's gone..."
23;178100;180030;"This isn't mere invisibility."
24;181030;182880;"Does he also have the ability"
25;182880;186920;"to change locations instantly, 
without making any sound?"
26;187440;188650;"That isn't possible!"
27;189190;190580;"How did he do it?!"
28;193490;194960;"Where'd you come from?"
29;196460;198380;"I've been here the entire time."
30;198630;199550;"Huh?"
31;199550;203200;"My second ability is Perfect Plan."
32;203370;210810;"{\fad(1126,1)}God's Alibi
Perfect Plan"
33;205130;207570;"When I hold my breath,"
34;207570;210810;"no one can sense my existence."
35;211120;214560;"You were even touching me..."
36;214560;217820;"But your mind didn't realize it."
37;217820;219940;"Eh? I touched you?"
38;221790;224330;"You know how some people are easily overlooked?"
39;224330;226490;"When you go to a restaurant in a group,"
40;226490;229760;"there's always one person that the 
waitress forgets to bring water."
41;229760;231830;"This is an extreme version."
42;231830;235710;"I'm right here, but no one notices me."
43;235710;236840;"Oh..."
44;237350;240920;"I use my other ability to turn invisible"
45;240920;245000;"to cover this one so no one can learn about it."
46;245550;250700;"For the record, you and I are 
the only ones in the world"
47;251760;253440;"who know this."
48;255780;258050;"Why tell me something so important?"
49;258540;261540;"Well, it's to build trust."
50;261540;264840;"Since I'm the one who has to take a risk..."
51;265190;269030;"If I can't convince you to trust me, 
we can't start anything."
52;269400;272540;"You mean, what you said about 
me being a valuable partner?"
53;272860;276300;"Yeah, but that's for later."
54;278280;281580;"Like I said, we have to trust each other first."
55;281580;286550;"Once you've agreed to be my 
partner, I'll tell you more."
56;286720;288390;"Okay, I'll be your partner."
57;289140;289970;"That was fast!"
58;290920;293080;"You don't know how to bargain, kid."
59;293080;295180;"Don't be so trusting of me!"
60;295180;296150;"Suspect everyone!"
61;296150;298440;"Until you've done due diligence, 
don't trust anyone!"
62;298440;299250;"Huh?"
63;299250;301610;"I said it's okay, so why are 
you being so difficult?"
64;301610;304660;"Can you even make this decision on your own?!"
65;304660;305900;"What about your buddy?"
66;305900;307180;"He'll have a fit"
67;307180;310870;"when he hears you teamed up with 
a suspicious-looking monster..."
68;312440;315050;"And why am I insulting myself?"
69;315050;318240;"I didn't choose to be this way!"
70;318240;320420;"He talks a lot..."
71;321370;322800;"Whatever."
72;323450;327430;"Even a friend of twenty years 
could stab you in the back."
73;327620;330170;"Time is no measure of trust!"
74;330170;332180;"Say, "Ho"!"
75;333140;335320;"You're no fun..."
76;335800;337250;"We can never be friends."
77;337790;339940;"I feel the same way..."
78;341120;343390;"Then, are you sure about this?"
79;343390;344350;"About what?"
80;344350;346190;"About teaming up with me."
81;346190;348280;"Won't your buddy object?"
82;348790;350570;"Most likely."
83;350570;352790;"Because he tends to be cautious 
and to question everything."
84;353320;354790;"This won't work, then."
85;354790;356870;"The deal's dead in the water."
86;357270;360580;"But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine."
87;360580;362980;"Killua won't like it, but he'll give in."
88;363940;367380;"Really... He must have a hard time."
89;367970;371780;"Well, whatever. 
If you say it's okay, I'll trust you."
90;371780;373360;"So let's get to business."
91;373360;374070;"Yeah."
92;376980;378770;"I want to defeat the King."
93;381010;382800;"Want to know why?"
94;382800;384900;"Yeah, of course."
95;385510;387270;"That's what I've been waiting for..."
96;388360;389800;"Revenge."
97;393220;397260;"Right now, I can't tell you 
why I want revenge..."
98;397260;398080;"Okay."
99;398080;400240;"I'd like to know, but I'll wait."
100;400630;402690;"That's probably what he wants to hear..."
101;403950;406910;"If you're that curious, I'll tell you."
102;406910;408050;"You'll tell me now?!"
103;408050;409870;"Just kidding!"
104;409870;412680;"Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now."
105;412680;414430;"I didn't beg you for anything."
106;421170;423400;"The King killed someone I owed my life to."
107;424960;426680;"His name was Peggy."
108;427330;430320;"I saw the King behead him right before my eyes."
109;433490;437830;"But at the time, I didn't realize 
what had happened."
110;438320;439860;"Huh? Why not?"
111;439860;441780;"You saw it happen, didn't you?"
112;447360;450720;"Because I'd forgotten that Peggy"
113;451160;453940;"was the one who raised me."
114;460170;465980;"A little while ago, I began to recover my 
memories from when I was human."
115;467330;469580;"I haven't remembered everything."
116;471540;473300;"No, I should rephrase that..."
117;473780;476260;"I've only remembered a few things."
118;476680;481750;"The names of my parents, my name, 
episodes from my childhood."
119;482520;486120;"Peggy was the name of the 
Chimera Ant the King killed."
120;486900;491110;"That was also my foster father's human name."
121;492000;496970;"He was into education, and always 
carried thick books around."
122;500650;505730;"In both life and death, he never 
parted with his books about NGL."
123;506630;509730;"Then you all have memories 
from when you were human?"
124;509730;512240;"I don't know if we're all the same."
125;512580;516530;"Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature."
126;516530;519340;"With others, there's no 
telling what they're thinking."
127;519340;521530;"But I think I understand now."
128;522840;527250;"This is why, when we first met, 
I was willing to trust you."
129;528270;530160;"You're very human."
130;530620;533050;"More human than any other 
Chimera Ant I've met."
131;533460;536220;"In fact, I'd say you're still human."
132;536590;540800;"Really? When I met you, 
I had the opposite reaction."
133;540800;541750;"Huh?"
134;541750;545810;"I could sense a vicious beast inside you."
135;546200;548500;"That's why I wanted to team up."
136;549020;551820;"There's no limit to what you'll do."
137;554960;557320;"All right... Now, let's get down to business."
138;557900;563080;"But first, could you tell me your name?"
139;565270;567570;"I'm Gon... Gon Freecss."
140;568820;571790;"I actually have one more ability."
141;571790;574520;"And the condition for its 
activation has been met."
142;577960;581220;"Time to show you my third power!"
143;588100;589480;"Activate!"
144;618660;620240;"It isn't flying away..."
145;626440;630650;"Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?"
146;630850;632520;"Exactly."
147;632520;636380;"This is my third power, God's Accomplice."
148;636820;643160;"While Perfect Plan is active, it allows 
anyone I touch to use it, as well."
149;646360;649990;"Do you understand how powerful 
this technique is now?"
150;650510;654680;"This power will let us approach 
and attack the enemy..."
151;656450;658170;"without their knowledge."
152;658680;660830;"The King's strength doesn't matter..."
153;660830;665380;"If we can sneak up and use a powerful 
attack when his guard is lowered, we'll win."
154;667960;669370;"Hey, Gon..."
155;669940;673020;"You're the partner I've been looking for."
156;674870;676650;"The perfect guy to smack the King"
157;676650;680600;"with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!"
158;687520;689300;"I was watching"
159;689960;692960;"when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing."
160;694020;696130;"Those were my soldiers."
161;697080;701260;"I sent them to attack, so I could 
measure your strength,"
162;702490;704320;"but they..."
163;705230;707540;"Ah, no need to feel bad..."
164;707540;711480;"They were killing for sport when 
I wasn't paying attention."
165;711930;715110;"They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies."
166;715720;720780;"Well, from their perspective, 
I'm the one who's changed."
167;722590;724390;"What you said about being your partner..."
168;726110;728120;"There's someone who'd be better than me."
169;729010;730650;"You know someone?"
170;731160;731950;"Yep."
171;733590;734750;"I'll contact him."
172;734750;735770;"Hold on."
173;736870;739360;"I trust you."
174;739360;745150;"And even if you end up turning on me, 
I won't blame you or regret my decision."
175;745150;749950;"Because I watched you, spoke to you, 
and decided to trust you."
176;751060;757610;"But I'm not about to trust others 
just because you trust them."
177;757610;759020;"Do you understand?"
178;760300;762160;"I get your point, but..."
179;762160;765030;"My life is on the line here."
180;767260;768550;"Listen to me."
181;768550;771820;"Perfect Plan is not invincible."
182;771820;773790;"In fact, it's highly vulnerable."
183;773790;776760;"I can make people ignore my existence,"
184;776760;781450;"but I'm still right there in the same place.
They just don't notice me."
185;781450;785800;"So their attacks can still hit me."
186;786300;791680;"Knowing there's a person around with 
my ability, what would someone do?"
187;792020;795160;"They'd launch attacks in every direction."
188;795160;796690;"Oh, you're right..."
189;797010;801730;"If one of those attacks hits me, 
even by dumb luck, I'm done for."
190;801730;803130;"I hate to admit it,"
191;803130;806700;"but when it comes to combat, 
I'm the weakest Chimera Ant around."
192;806700;808710;"I'm on the same level as foot soldiers."
193;808710;809960;"Forget the King..."
194;809960;813200;"I couldn't even survive a punch 
from a Squadron Leader."
195;813920;817640;"If I just turn invisible, 
others can locate me with <i>En</i>."
196;817640;821710;"It's been tested, so the other 
Squadron Leaders know this, too."
197;822230;826830;"I need my enemies to believe 
my power to be weak."
198;826830;829640;"They need to think <i>En</i> is enough to beat it."
199;830350;836390;"This ability is only invincible 
if no one knows about it."
200;837800;840000;"Enough explaining..."
201;840000;844010;"My point is that I don't want to 
reveal my power to any others!"
202;844010;847110;"Not even if it's someone you trust."
203;849280;851230;"You can see for yourself, then."
204;853110;856160;"I'll call him out here without mentioning you."
205;856570;857750;"W-Wait..."
206;858180;859990;"You can watch from a distance."
207;861840;862380;"Hello—"
208;862380;865350;"Yo! I've been waiting, fool!"
209;865350;867770;"You pulled a fast one! Where are you?"
210;868860;871250;"I've got lots of questions for you."
211;873000;875750;"Because of you kids, the boss 
had to make a move..."
212;876250;881020;"The plan's been derailed, 
but I support what you're doing."
213;883130;886800;"Letting five million die isn't right."
214;887670;890950;"The boss used his power to surround the capital."
215;890950;892170;"Really?"
216;892170;897770;"That should make it harder for Neferpitou 
to control puppets remotely."
217;897770;902020;"In other words, they can't perform 
the selection from a distance."
218;902020;903040;"Right."
219;903040;909270;"But the boss and Knov-san will be expending 
all their energy to delay Neferpitou."
220;909270;911850;"Which means, when the operation starts,"
221;911850;916640;"they won't be in any condition to 
take on any of the Royal Guard."
222;918880;924210;"We expect more citizens to gather 
in the capital for the celebration."
223;924210;927030;"There may be a massacre yet."
224;927030;929540;"The situation's still grim..."
225;932870;935870;"We can no longer contact the Chairman."
226;936200;941250;"He's holed up somewhere until the last 
possible minute, preparing for the final battle."
227;948230;950600;"We four need to make a decision."
228;951210;956140;"Do we summon reinforcements, or do we 
face the three Royal Guards by ourselves?"
229;958610;960460;"I'd like to know Killua's opinion."
230;961070;962470;"He isn't here."
231;963020;965040;"What? You split up?"
232;966050;969440;"I get it... He's been disrupting things alone."
233;969440;971150;"Can you call him real quick?"
234;976050;978150;"No luck. He isn't picking up..."
235;978150;979290;"I think his is off."
236;979640;982920;"Really? Well, keep trying."
237;983340;986710;"We should meet up, the sooner the better."
238;986710;987570;"Yeah."
239;987570;991690;"Let's find a halfway point to meet."
240;993210;995360;"Here... Mandai City."
241;995680;997470;"Okay, got it."
242;1015510;1016320;"Checkmate."
243;1018390;1019390;"You're done."
244;1024640;1027080;"Why didn't you resign?"
245;1034190;1035850;"Don't make me repeat myself."
246;1035850;1040350;"The match ended twenty-two moves ago."
247;1040720;1043100;"Why did you not resign then?"
248;1043700;1046480;"Did you believe I would make a mistake?"
249;1062600;1063890;"Idiot."
250;1066180;1068730;"Next, we have the national Go champion."
251;1070100;1071550;"Give me the rulebook."
252;1074530;1078300;"It may look simple at first, 
but it is a complex game."
253;1079140;1081660;"It may take more time to learn than shogi."
254;1095360;1097470;"Please let me leave!"
255;1097470;1098700;"What do you want?"
256;1099430;1102470;"Someone! Help me!"
257;1105820;1106900;"My glasses..."
258;1106900;1107990;"Silence."
259;1109080;1110620;"You are in the King's presence."
260;1118620;1120180;"The choice is yours."
261;1121710;1124430;"Sit across from me now."
262;1125490;1126680;"Or die."
263;1133820;1135390;"5.5 points."
264;1135390;1136820;"The King wins."
265;1137700;1139540;"I-It only took him ten games?"
266;1140930;1143000;"I'm t-tired!"
267;1143000;1144680;"It's the only explanation for that loss!"
268;1144680;1146540;"And I think I have a fever."
269;1146540;1147480;"I'm short on sleep."
270;1147480;1148460;"And I feel dizzy..."
271;1149580;1150620;"I'll give you eight hours."
272;1151270;1152420;"And any medicine you need."
273;1153010;1154930;"I expect you to be in top condition."
274;1156140;1159250;"Should you lose again, I won't 
be interested in excuses."
275;1160500;1162140;"Rest as if your life depends on it."
276;1167550;1171950;"I'm impressed by how quickly 
you learn these games."
277;1172680;1176540;"I can't believe it took less than half 
the time you spent mastering shogi."
278;1177020;1179260;"It's all about learning the feel."
279;1180120;1183200;"Chess, Go, shogi..."
280;1183760;1186650;"They have different rules, but all three"
281;1186650;1189620;"have a certain rhythm to their moves."
282;1190840;1194170;"That means disrupting your 
opponent's rhythm is crucial."
283;1194780;1198630;"Once you've learned the openings, 
you can deduce your opponent's rhythm."
284;1200510;1204390;"Once you know their rhythm, 
you need only disrupt it."
285;1205450;1208890;"A psychological principle that 
would apply to any contest."
286;1209500;1214220;"If you've already reached that conclusion, 
I don't see the benefit of playing more games."
287;1215030;1217600;"I believe they will only bore you."
288;1219090;1220950;"How many remain?"
289;1221550;1225110;"This country has one more professional game."
290;1225430;1227700;"It's a board game called Gungi."
291;1228790;1229870;"Gungi?"
292;1230360;1232990;"The game originated in East Gorteau,"
293;1232990;1236130;"and nearly all citizens know how to play."
294;1236400;1238050;"Give me the rulebook."
295;1241900;1245900;"As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king."
296;1246500;1249430;"But you can stack up to three pieces."
297;1249430;1253770;"At the start, you may also freely place 
your pieces within your own area."
298;1254330;1257080;"The game has a different feel"
299;1257080;1260780;"due to the addition of a third dimension."
300;1261770;1265810;"For the past fifteen years, 
there have been world tournaments,"
301;1265810;1268630;"and East Gorteau has yet to lose."
302;1269630;1273790;"Currently, they're on their third representative, 
a five-time reigning champion."
303;1275720;1279040;"Then, if I defeat this champion, 
I'll be the best in the world?"
304;1279690;1282140;"A fitting way to end this recreation."
305;1283000;1284020;"Bring them in."
306;1306270;1308560;"There are six days until the selection."
307;1309070;1312580;"The King has no idea"
308;1312580;1317580;"how this girl is about to influence his fate."
309;1404770;1406960;"Next time: Check x And x Mate."
310;1406960;1407940;"I'm Gon."
311;1407940;1409000;"I'm Gillua."
312;1409000;1410290;"Did you change your name?"
313;1410290;1411370;"No way."
314;1411370;1412340;"Say it again."
315;1412340;1413720;"I'm Gillua!"
316;1413720;1414430;"GG!"
