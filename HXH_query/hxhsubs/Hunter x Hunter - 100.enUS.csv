and disabling my puppets."
2;5260;6610;"Can you kill them?"
3;7400;8940;"You can count on me."
4;11300;13470;"Hmm... No problem."
5;14270;16660;"You can bring out tanks and fighter jets."
6;17750;19250;"I will stop them all."

8;106780;111910;"Knuckle and Shoot are on the 
move to capture Cheetu"
9;111910;113660;"as he attempts to return to the King."
10;119440;120630;"He's close."
11;120630;121530;"Okay."
12;123680;125000;"He's following the road."
13;125740;129010;"If he continues on it, 
he'll pass by in ten minutes."
14;129010;131750;"Do you think he'll stick to the road?"
15;131750;135470;"No, he'll notice my presence 
just before he gets here."
16;135900;140030;"Because APR will start adding interest again."
17;140240;142530;"But given his speed..."
18;143080;147980;"We may be able to attack him 
just before APR adds interest."

Chapter 7 Bankruptcy"
20;149610;151920;"Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,"
21;151920;153540;"attaches APR to an enemy."
22;154070;157470;"Every ten seconds, APR informs the 
enemy that interest will be added."
23;157470;163850;"But if the enemy is over a hundred meters 
away from Knuckle, the interest stops."
24;164430;167830;"When this happens, the time 
until the next interest payment"
25;167830;170150;"is remembered by APR."
26;170670;174980;"Once the enemy is back within 
Knuckle's hundred-meter range,"
27;174980;178030;"APR picks up where it stopped."
28;179830;184080;"He's approaching at a speed between 
160 and 180 kilometers per hour."
29;184640;188830;"If there are still three seconds or more 
before APR adds interest again,"
30;188830;193130;"there's a good chance we can 
attack before he notices us."
31;194130;194880;"Here he comes!"
32;206640;207620;"What's wrong?"
33;209330;210850;"Damn, what happened?"
34;211680;214080;"At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!"
35;215050;215940;"He's down below!"
36;215940;216700;"Knuckle..."
37;217550;219300;"Don't bother. We can't catch up."
38;219300;221820;"Our opponent has a cheetah's speed."
39;223070;225530;"He isn't supposed to know 
how to deal with <i>Zetsu</i>."
40;225970;228020;"How did he discover our ambush?"
41;228560;229500;"Could it be..."
42;235740;237420;"We're slightly downwind."
43;238810;241510;"The breeze is blowing this way 
with no change in direction."
44;241510;242790;"So he didn't smell us."
45;242790;243610;"Look up!"
46;246400;247680;"What's that?"
47;249320;251790;"I've discovered two suspicious figures."
48;251790;252690;"What should I do?"
49;253090;256500;"Ignore them. They aren't the target."
50;256500;259440;"No point in doing more work than necessary."
51;259440;260190;"Yes, sir."
52;260900;264830;"It appears they were trying 
to ambush Cheetu-sama."
53;264830;267950;"Oh, he's in the area?"
54;268430;271830;"I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap."
55;271830;273660;"Was that unnecessary?"
56;274610;276150;"What did Cheetu do?"
57;276150;278230;"He took a detour toward the capital."
58;278230;281010;"He told me to thank you for the help."
59;281970;283840;"I see, good work."
60;284980;286870;"He owes me now."
61;289290;290510;"This is Leol."
62;290510;294700;"The target just engaged a squad of 
soldiers in the city of Longtong."
63;295550;296770;"Longtong?"
64;297190;299880;"Head north and try to cut it off."
65;299880;301520;"Just a hunch."
66;301940;302850;"Understood."
67;303570;306230;"Looks like even the army can't handle this."
68;306230;309840;"No... Well, they're only there to buy time."
69;309840;314120;"They've had to stay in one area 
for a longer period of time."
70;314440;319680;"After all, it's been moving constantly 
for over thirty hours."
71;323890;326380;"Diego has fallen into enemy hands!"
72;326890;329640;"If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!"
73;329640;331050;"Liar!"
74;331050;331890;"Rebel scum!"
75;333820;338770;"Damn... Diego just appeared on TV, 
looking alive and well."
76;338770;340410;"The odds are against me now."
77;341530;343400;"I'll have to give up my instigation."
78;343400;347020;"My only option is to take out as many 
puppets and soldiers as I can!"
79;352060;355410;"Should I go north next?"
80;361140;362210;"I knew it."
81;362530;364340;"Someone's still following me!"
82;366370;367430;"Who's there?!"
83;367430;369360;"If you want something, show yourself!"
84;373480;375400;"The presence has completely vanished."
85;376030;379430;"It might be following me until 
more Chimera Ants show up."
86;381770;383360;"I'm gonna shake it!"
87;383740;385860;"It can't outlast me!"
88;387920;388760;"Yo..."
89;388760;389410;"Yo."
90;389880;392080;"Sorry for stopping you."
91;392080;394630;"Nah, I was headed this way."
92;394630;396950;"The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?"
93;398350;400080;"Yeah, I know. It's Leol now."
94;400780;403050;"Then you did that on purpose?"
95;403050;404840;"You're still a bastard."
96;404960;407630;"Flutter's warning was a big help."
97;407630;409810;"Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights..."
98;410280;411870;"I'm glad to hear that."
99;412420;414220;"By the way, what's that thing?"
100;416640;417820;"No idea."
101;417820;420250;"A Hunter hit me with it."
102;420990;423310;"It follows me wherever I run."
103;423310;424230;"Not sure what to do."
104;424750;428290;"But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect."
105;428760;430160;"Want me to get rid of it?"
106;431380;433740;"Do you want me to get rid of it?"
107;435430;436430;"You can do that?"
108;437070;438370;"Probably."
109;439200;440620;"But not for free, right?"
110;442360;444380;"I'm glad you're so understanding."
111;444380;445940;"Figured."
112;446330;449160;"The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission."
113;449160;451040;"I'd like your help."
114;451040;452380;"Leol-sama..."
115;453390;455350;"I've spotted the target."
116;455350;459390;"He's headed north on the road through 
the forest northeast of Longtong."
117;461610;465050;"Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right..."
118;465550;467210;"Don't let him get away."
119;467210;469410;"Use all your forces to slow him down."
120;469790;470400;"Yes, sir."
121;471530;473510;"We're chasing down a human."
122;473510;474990;"He's probably a Hunter."
123;475850;478260;"And you want me to help hunt him?"
124;478800;480410;"You said he's a Hunter?"
125;480410;483380;"They can be tough to deal with..."
126;483380;486180;"Of course, so I've planned ahead."
127;487170;491850;"Shaiapouf-dono has prepared 
a power tailored for you."
128;491850;494430;"He will teach you to use it."
129;494430;497050;"With luck, you can master it in a day."
130;497050;501460;"I'm a slow learner, so mine took me 
three days to get the hang of."
131;502390;504540;"Sounds like a sweet deal..."
132;505600;507950;"In return, I swear loyalty to the King?"
133;509490;512040;"Exactly... Easy enough, right?"
134;513020;515310;"Sure, I just wanted an explanation."
135;516490;518850;"You're a sharp fellow."
136;518850;520950;"If you accept, return to the castle,"
137;520950;524140;"master your new power, 
and then contact me."
138;524610;528270;"In the meantime, I'll have my underlings 
determine the target's abilities."
139;529520;531570;"Well, I guess I owe you one."
140;531570;532990;"Might as well."
141;532990;537080;"Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory."
142;538900;540210;"Naturally."
143;540540;542980;"I was once king of the jungle."
144;545060;547800;"Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne."
145;550100;553130;"Damn, I'm being followed."
146;553600;556520;"And he's way out of yo-yo range."
147;556520;559240;"If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble."
148;563810;565500;"There's a jungle over there!"
149;566930;568810;"The leaves are dense enough,"
150;568810;571270;"he shouldn't be able to see me from the air."
151;571730;574790;"If he descends to follow, 
he'll be in range of my yo-yo!"
152;584500;585340;"He isn't coming?"
153;585770;586760;"Did I lose him?"
154;587110;591010;"But in that case, he should 
come looking for me."
155;592800;594010;"Damn..."
156;594010;595860;"I don't have time to wait around!"
157;595860;597530;"Hurry up, already!"
158;599580;602530;"You can't hide from me."
159;603200;605230;"Go forth, soldiers of Leol."
160;605230;607290;"Capture your prey!"
161;612030;614390;"Something's coming, but from the opposite side,"
162;614390;615550;"and it's on the ground!"
163;629790;633320;"He removed his foe's head 
and arms with one swing!"
164;633470;635770;"I can't beat him in a one-on-one, 
close-quarters fight..."
165;636170;637480;"Where is he?!"
166;637480;638900;"Captain! Above you!"
167;661200;662240;"I'm gonna die—"
168;669480;670980;"I missed two of them!"
169;671580;675170;"We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,
and we can't even touch him!"
170;675170;675900;"Retreat!"
171;675900;676980;"Time to regroup!"
172;678620;680110;"I won't let you escape..."
173;680390;682110;"You must be the leader."
174;682110;683940;"I'll eliminate you first!"
175;694370;697800;"How'd you like that blast?"
176;706950;708890;"That bastard..."
177;708890;711690;"He blew a fart at me!"
178;713500;715410;"No, there's a bigger problem..."
179;715800;719440;"I completely concealed my presence, 
and attacked from his blind spot."
180;719440;721750;"But he countered at the perfect time."
181;723270;725980;"Someone must be instructing 
him from a distance."
182;727650;728790;"It must be him!"
183;729540;732040;"He's probably watching right now."
184;732040;735670;"I'd guess he has a power that 
lets him track my location."
185;737100;738300;"In that case..."
186;740300;742680;"I can't show him the cards 
in my hand, no matter what."
187;742680;746110;"I don't want them to learn 
of my lightning or yo-yo!"
188;747200;750390;"The ideal scenario would be to lose 
them and go back into hiding."
189;750390;751930;"But that's looking impossible."
190;752370;753840;"I'll have to defeat them all without using—"
191;756420;757360;"A gun?"
192;758610;759430;"No..."
193;759430;761440;"There's something stuck to my face..."
194;766030;766960;"A flea?"
195;773490;774430;"A flea?"
196;777990;779290;"Damn!"
197;779760;781510;"Where did it come from?!"
198;784550;790670;"Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2."
199;790670;795320;"Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1."
200;797590;798770;"Okay."
201;804000;807740;"There's no escaping..."
202;808250;814400;"from my Fleadom, oh yeah."
203;819650;820960;"Damn!"
204;821640;823730;"The bleeding won't stop."
205;823730;826150;"These fleas are more than just big bugs..."
206;827290;832220;"Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4."
207;832220;837090;"Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1."
208;837090;838400;"Okay."
209;854880;858140;"The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage."
210;858140;862670;"The real goal is to exhaust my 
strength through blood loss!"
211;867720;873930;"My fleas are very special..."
212;875260;878430;"They have a 200-meter vertical leap."
213;880080;882690;"And when you factor in..."
214;886390;890690;"my air gun's power,"
215;890690;895120;"they become unstoppable, oh yeah."
216;897660;900150;"Oh? He's already able to dodge them?"
217;900150;903260;"No wonder those apes couldn't do anything."
218;905330;909850;"If I keep running around, it'll be 
harder for them to snipe me!"
219;909850;912890;"But I have to conserve stamina."
220;919420;921590;"Ah, he's going to try something."
221;922210;924830;"He may try to use his power."
222;925720;928240;"Let's see what he can do."
223;928550;929970;"Okay."
224;941400;945410;"My Super Eye allows me to observe a target"
225;945410;948710;"from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies."
226;948710;951430;"No ability you use can escape my sight."
227;952110;954450;"Now, let's see what you do."
228;968310;970520;"Killua cannot use <i>En</i>."
229;970990;976280;"Expanding his aura around him 
and maintaining it for a long time"
230;976280;978230;"is by no means his forte."
231;979300;981520;"Killua knows this shortcoming."
232;981970;985700;"And so, he keeps his aura within 
the range he can best manage."
233;986130;988360;"A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body."
234;988360;989340;"Not much room to work with."
235;991260;996970;"In other words, the moment a projectile is 
within fifty-seven centimeters of his body,"
236;997330;1000500;"Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes"
237;1000500;1004060;"and physical strength to react 
with desperate speed,"
238;1004060;1005760;"and dodge at point-blank range."
239;1009860;1012860;"But this time, he didn't dodge!"
240;1014500;1017620;"All to determine the angle of 
the projectile's approach."
241;1019200;1021910;"Damn... It came from this way!"
242;1026240;1030880;"He let himself be hit, so he 
could locate the sniper."
243;1031410;1034310;"The target is quickly heading your way."
244;1034990;1036390;"Okay."
245;1037090;1041640;"I somewhat expected this."
246;1043760;1046980;"The bleeding's stopped anywhere 
that the fleas only scratched me."
247;1048260;1052320;"They must secrete some chemical that 
stops blood from clotting naturally."
248;1053280;1056440;"If I start bleeding in too many 
places, I'll be in trouble."
249;1056440;1057910;"I can't let him escape!"
250;1062830;1064230;"This is perfect."
251;1064230;1067240;"I can see clearly in every direction."
252;1068960;1070130;"How do you like this?"
253;1070130;1071670;"There's nowhere for you to hide!"
254;1072190;1073670;"Bring it on!"
255;1085250;1086340;"Wait!"
256;1088090;1091060;"This desert is massive."
257;1091060;1094100;"If you don't have any water, 
you'll die of thirst in a day."
258;1101670;1103350;"Too bad..."
259;1103350;1106390;"I wanted to observe you a little longer,"
260;1106390;1108170;"but I guess that won't work."
261;1108170;1110960;"I was running low on stamina, anyway."
262;1110960;1114480;"I suppose this gives us more 
time to talk things over..."
263;1115000;1117060;"Let's begin with introductions."
264;1118530;1122430;"My name is Jail... 
Scratch that, it's Meleoron."
265;1122790;1126020;"When the Queen was still alive, 
I was a Squadron Leader."
266;1126020;1127420;"Nice to meet you."
267;1128110;1129690;"What's your name?"
268;1131260;1132940;"Why were you following me?"
269;1133570;1136100;"Because I didn't want to let you get away."
270;1136100;1138450;"And I certainly couldn't let you die..."
271;1139180;1142450;"Because you'll be a valuable partner."
272;1144680;1146860;"You have business with the King, right?"
273;1146860;1147870;"I do not!"
274;1147870;1148520;"Huh?"
275;1150170;1151960;"That was dangerous..."
276;1151960;1154710;"He must have a reason for approaching me."
277;1154710;1156090;"I can't tell him anything."
278;1156950;1161400;"Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?"
279;1161400;1162550;""You guys"?"
280;1164310;1169720;"Yep... I've been watching you since 
that other kid was with you."
281;1170300;1171230;"I understand."
282;1173110;1177440;"And you felt that I would put up 
less of a fight than Killua!"
283;1177440;1179150;"Huh? Eh?!"
284;1179150;1180540;"You've got it all wrong!"
285;1180540;1182360;"That's how you interpret it?"
286;1182630;1184730;"I guess it makes sense..."
287;1184730;1188190;"To you, I'd look like an enemy."
288;1188190;1190880;"I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first."
289;1191330;1192120;"Listen up."
290;1192120;1194130;"I swear that I'm not lying."
291;1194130;1197630;"I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!"
292;1198080;1199880;"Okay, I believe you."
293;1199880;1202950;"Of course... It's hard to believe!"
294;1202950;1204520;"I can sympathize."
295;1204520;1207550;"If I were in your shoes..."
296;1208370;1209270;"Eh?"
297;1213610;1214810;"Is that him?"
298;1231140;1233160;"This is a trap."
299;1233160;1236510;"You still wanna come?"
300;1240470;1241730;"Couldn't care less."
301;1241730;1242600;"Die."
302;1243170;1245790;"He instantly acted to kill me..."
303;1245790;1247420;"No hesitation at all."
304;1247420;1249000;"I'm impressed!"
305;1253100;1254150;"An underground lake?"
306;1254760;1256360;"Lookin' for a taste of hell?"
307;1256830;1259080;"Here you go!"
308;1263650;1264250;"Blood!"
309;1264250;1265250;"Food!"
310;1265250;1266870;"It's food!"
311;1269960;1271620;"Wait, this is..."
312;1272110;1274550;"Captain Ikalgo's host!"
313;1275500;1277750;"Crap, stop eating it."
314;1278100;1280640;"I want to stop, but I can't..."
315;1280640;1285260;"The blood is calling to us!"
316;1287180;1288010;"Bastard!"
317;1288350;1294270;"How dare you chop off my precious legs?!"
318;1295320;1298400;"I couldn't let you drag me into the water."
319;1298790;1300650;"These suction cups saved me."
320;1301120;1303780;"Anyway, aren't you an octopus?"
321;1304300;1306530;"Don't call me an octopus!"
322;1310320;1313660;"Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo,"
323;1313660;1316950;"a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling 
an octopus, that uses human hosts."
324;1317280;1320920;"Don't call me an octopus!"
325;1405500;1408110;"Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning."
326;1408110;1411020;"What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?"
327;1411020;1411750;"An octopus."
328;1411750;1413790;"Don't call me an octopus!"
