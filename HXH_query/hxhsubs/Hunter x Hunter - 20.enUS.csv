drawn to that magic."

8;160910;165890;"Baffling x Turn Of x Events"
9;168460;169990;"You're awake?"
10;171160;172380;"Where am I?"
11;172840;176030;"A waiting room, next to the 
arena for the Final Phase."
12;177940;180470;"Upsie-daisy..."
13;181620;185270;"Right. I was in the middle 
of the Hunter Exam."
14;186410;188880;"Your arm will heal quickly."
15;188880;191730;"The break was very clean."
16;191730;196240;"In fact, once it heals, the bone 
will be stronger than before."
17;197830;199050;"In any case,"
18;199050;201590;"congratulations on passing the exam."
19;207510;209610;"Satotz-san, I..."
20;209610;210430;"You can't."
21;215330;219650;"Just as someone who has failed 
the exam can no longer pass,"
22;219650;223550;"someone who has passed 
the exam can no longer fail."
23;224440;226990;"The rest is up to you."
24;227440;230280;"If you feel you are unqualified to be a pro,"
25;230280;234650;"you are free to destroy or 
put away your license."
26;234650;236960;"You can even sell it,"
27;236960;239600;"since no one else will be able to use it."
28;240030;241130;"However,"
29;241690;247140;"a person who has passed the exam will 
not be allowed to take it again."
30;248580;250840;"Professional Hunters are treated well,"
31;250840;254020;"largely due to our predecessors' efforts."
32;254260;260150;"Hence, there are many applicants 
who harbor ill intentions."
33;260490;262650;"If it weren't for them,"
34;263190;267290;"we would accept every person who applied."
35;273590;275740;"Most professional Hunters consider"
36;275740;279850;"this card more valuable than their own lives,"
37;279850;283490;"yet no more than a worthless scrap 
of paper at the same time."
38;284110;285300;"The important thing"
39;285680;289930;"is what you accomplish once 
you become a Hunter."
40;291730;294180;"What I accomplish..."
41;295770;296940;"Gon-kun,"
42;297370;300590;"you can decide for yourself when 
you're ready to use this card."
43;301210;303430;"I have faith in your judgment."
44;311290;312410;"Okay."
45;312410;316830;"A lot of people helped me reach this point."
46;317180;320340;"I'll use this once I've returned the favor."
47;320950;324320;"Then allow me to congratulate you."
48;324870;326720;"Thank you, Satotz-san."
49;329850;331760;"What about the other applicants?"
50;331760;333720;"The exam is still going on, right?"
51;335460;338230;"No, the exam is over."
52;339330;340530;"Really?"
53;340530;344410;"Yes, you slept for nearly an entire day."
54;344980;346300;"Really?"
55;346300;350050;"The others who passed are currently 
completing a brief orientation."
56;350050;352770;"You will undergo the orientation later."
57;353230;354620;"Who failed?"
58;356050;357870;"It was"
59;360740;362220;"Killua."
60;365070;368130;"Why did Killua fail?"
61;369130;372470;"First, let me fill you in on what transpired"
62;372470;374420;"after you were knocked out."
63;375130;378020;"That will help you understand 
what occurred."
64;382300;384350;"After you fell unconscious..."
65;389700;393410;"When he wakes up, he'll probably 
refuse his license."
66;394730;397540;"That sounds like something Gon would do."
67;399450;401970;"Only one person will fail this round, right?"
68;402480;408420;"If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the 
rest of our fights meaningless?"
69;408560;411680;"Don't worry. Gon has passed."
70;411980;415410;"Nothing he says can change that."
71;417220;420750;"If Gon were to throw a fit and kill me,"
72;420750;424420;"we still wouldn't be able 
to revoke his license."
73;424420;425800;"Very well."
74;429920;432950;"Why did you let him win?"
75;434540;436080;"Let him win?"
76;436080;440710;"I'm sure you knew how to make Gon 
surrender without killing him."
77;441190;442330;"Given your skills."
78;448190;450690;"When I torture someone,"
79;450690;453470;"I expect that person to hate me 
for the rest of their life."
80;454170;456850;"It's more effective and less stressful."
81;457400;458890;"When someone is in pain,"
82;458890;462600;"their eyes show a gleam of hostility toward 
the one responsible for that pain."
83;463090;466370;"Even with extensive training,"
84;466370;468980;"it is difficult to suppress 
that gleam of hate and rage."
85;469370;472240;"But there was no gleam in Gon's eyes."
86;472930;475060;"Can you believe it?"
87;475060;477480;"I had just broken his arm."
88;477480;482210;"{\fad(1,270)}But his eyes had already 
forgotten about that."
89;484640;487880;"I guess you could say that he won me over."
90;489610;492630;"If you need a reason, there you go."
91;496210;499140;"Gon-kun, you were able to 
win over your opponent."
92;499690;502240;"Hanzo said so himself."
93;504950;508520;"After that, the second match began."
94;509030;512280;"The second match is Kurapika versus Hisoka."
95;513360;514030;"Begin!"
96;518130;521160;"After the two of them fought for a while..."
97;525330;526310;"Wha—"
98;534160;535580;"I lose."
99;535580;536300;"Huh?"
100;536720;539650;"And Kurapika won."
101;539650;541310;"What did Hisoka say?"
102;541610;542890;"I don't know,"
103;542890;547060;"but Hisoka voluntarily conceded."
104;547480;550570;"The third match pit Hanzo against Pokkle."
105;551900;555280;"Pokkle found himself in much 
the same position as you,"
106;555280;558570;"but he admitted defeat immediately."
107;558900;561560;"Sorry, but I won't go easy on you."
108;562520;565210;"That sealed the deal."
109;566100;568960;"The fourth match was between 
Hisoka and Bodoro."
110;582340;584640;"The match was extremely one-sided,"
111;585040;588150;"but Bodoro refused to give up."
112;592230;595580;"However, while Bodoro 
was lying on the floor,"
113;595580;598010;"Hisoka whispered something in his ear."
114;599500;602760;"And Bodoro surrendered."
115;603890;606540;"The fifth match featured Killua and Pokkle,"
116;606540;609420;"but as soon as the fight began, 
Killua walked away."
117;610890;613660;"Confidently, he declared..."
118;614590;618050;"Sorry, but I'm not interested in fighting you."
119;618730;622300;"He must have felt that he 
could win his next match."
120;622920;624180;"However,"
121;624500;627150;"Leorio requested that the sixth match"
122;627150;630270;"be postponed while Bodoro 
recovered from his injuries."
123;630770;635530;"So Killua and Gittarackur fought first."
124;637710;638530;"Begin!"
125;638980;643260;"That was when Killua made a fatal mistake."
126;655510;657300;"It's been too long, Kil."
127;693520;694640;"Brother..."
128;698070;708140;"Hunter Vocabulary"
129;704090;708140;"Illumi"
130;708410;712340;"Huh? Gittarackur is Killua's brother?"
131;712860;716480;"Yes, his name is Illumi."
132;722790;723830;"Hey."
133;725910;727930;"Killua's brother?"
134;727930;730660;"He used those needles to change 
the shape of his face?!"
135;735070;737670;"I heard that you cut up Mom and Milluki."
136;738090;739050;"I guess."
137;739760;741800;"Mom was crying."
138;742120;746180;"Anyone would cry if their 
son did that to them."
139;746430;747830;"Tears of joy."
140;749400;752940;"She was so happy to see that you'd grown up."
141;753400;756690;"But she was worried about you leaving home,"
142;756690;760270;"so she asked me to check up on you."
143;760270;761440;"What a coincidence."
144;762180;765470;"I didn't know you wanted to be a Hunter."
145;765970;770810;"I'm trying to get a license for my next job."
146;771410;774590;"I don't really want to be a Hunter."
147;774590;776710;"I just felt like taking the exam."
148;778470;779530;"I see..."
149;780180;781700;"That's a relief."
150;782010;784500;"Then I have some advice for you."
151;786090;788440;"You're not cut out to be a Hunter."
152;789710;791790;"You were born to be..."
153;795160;796650;"a killer."
154;803810;805580;"Is that really what he said?"
155;807600;809640;"Killua mentioned his family before,"
156;809640;811270;"but they sound crazy..."
157;811750;814120;"He wasn't finished yet."
158;814880;817880;"You're a puppet of darkness, without passion."
159;817880;822120;"You don't want anything or wish for anything."
160;822120;824260;"As one who lives in the shadows,"
161;824260;826660;"you can only feel pleasure"
162;826660;829140;"when people die."
163;830520;834080;"That's how Dad and I raised you."
164;835470;839270;"What would you accomplish 
by becoming a Hunter?"
165;841130;842200;"True,"
166;842830;846150;"I don't desire to become a Hunter."
167;846150;847290;"But..."
168;848480;851660;"I do have something I want..."
169;852000;852700;"You don't."
170;852700;853660;"I do!"
171;853660;855720;"There's something I really want!"
172;857700;860540;"Tell me what it is that you want."
173;867880;869180;"What's wrong?"
174;869180;871300;"There's nothing you really want, is there?"
175;871300;872420;"That's not it!"
176;879680;883200;"I want to become friends with Gon..."
177;887560;890880;"I'm sick of killing people..."
178;891770;893440;"I want to become friends with Gon,"
179;894720;896340;"and to live a normal life..."
180;897200;898330;"That's impossible."
181;899950;902820;"You'll never be able to make friends."
182;904680;909910;"Your only concern when you meet someone 
is whether you should kill them."
183;909910;912220;"That's how you were trained."
184;913630;916130;"You just don't know how to classify Gon"
185;916130;918360;"because he's too dazzling for your eyes."
186;918360;920660;"You don't actually want to 
become friends with him."
187;921740;923230;"You're wrong..."
188;923560;925600;"If you stay with him,"
189;925600;928360;"you'll end up wanting to kill him one day."
190;928690;932870;"You'll get the urge to see if 
you can kill him or not."
191;933260;937290;"Because you have the soul of a killer."
192;942710;944650;"As we mentioned before..."
193;944650;946250;"Yeah, I know!"
194;946250;947130;"Killua!"
195;947640;950800;"I don't give a damn if he's your brother."
196;950800;952910;"He's a worthless piece of crap!"
197;952910;954300;"Don't listen to him!"
198;954300;957220;"Just beat the crap out of 
him like usual and win!"
199;957700;960020;"You want to become friends with Gon?"
200;960020;961190;"Are you daft?"
201;962940;965810;"You already are friends!"
202;967380;970120;"I'm sure that's how Gon feels!"
203;970670;971700;"Really?"
204;972190;974200;"Hell, yeah, idiot!"
205;975020;977360;"Really... That's no good."
206;977360;980270;"He considers Kil a friend."
207;981380;983250;"Okay, I'll kill Gon."
208;987150;989460;"A killer doesn't need any friends."
209;989700;991570;"They'll only slow you down."
210;994150;995840;"Where is he?"
211;997990;999960;"P-Please wait!"
212;999960;1001410;"The match is still..."
213;1006650;1007650;"Where is he?"
214;1007650;1010740;"The waiting room over there..."
215;1011630;1012650;"Thank you."
216;1022570;1024200;"This won't do."
217;1024200;1028420;"I need a Hunter license to do my job..."
218;1028830;1031190;"But if I kill them, I'll fail,"
219;1031190;1034840;"and Kil will pass automatically."
220;1034840;1039190;"Oh, darn. The same thing 
will happen if I kill Gon."
221;1041170;1042060;"I know!"
222;1042590;1045190;"I'll pass the exam before killing Gon."
223;1048720;1050480;"Bastard..."
224;1051080;1053710;"If I wait until after passing the exam,"
225;1053710;1056990;"I can kill everyone here and 
still keep my license, right?"
226;1056990;1060620;"Yes, according to the rules."
227;1060900;1062490;"Did you hear that, Kil?"
228;1064590;1068250;"You have to beat me if 
you want to save Gon."
229;1073510;1076290;"Will you fight me for your friend's sake?"
230;1076680;1078280;"You can't do it."
231;1078280;1081190;"Because you're more worried"
232;1081190;1086140;"about whether or not you can defeat me."
233;1088670;1091900;"And you already have your answer:"
234;1092640;1095460;""I'm not strong enough to beat my brother.""
235;1096680;1099080;""Never fight an enemy you can't beat.""
236;1099550;1102790;"I drilled that into you..."
237;1104890;1106410;"Don't move!"
238;1106740;1111010;"If you move an inch, I'll assume 
that the fight has begun."
239;1111010;1113740;"And if our bodies make contact,"
240;1113740;1116570;"that will also mean the fight has begun."
241;1117130;1119450;"There's only one way to stop me."
242;1120170;1121550;"You know what that is."
243;1123400;1125060;"But don't forget..."
244;1125500;1130310;"If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die."
245;1132420;1133970;"Take him out, Killua!"
246;1134370;1137570;"We won't let him kill you or Gon!"
247;1138170;1140450;"We'll stop him, whatever it takes!"
248;1141150;1142930;"Let him have it!"
249;1152710;1153840;"I surrender."
250;1154760;1157590;"I lose..."
251;1163650;1165330;"Oh, that's good!"
252;1166040;1168230;"Then the battle's over."
253;1170200;1171520;"I lied, Kil."
254;1171520;1173410;"I was lying about killing Gon."
255;1173870;1176870;"That was just a little test."
256;1176870;1178990;"But now I have my answer."
257;1180960;1183980;"You don't have the right to make friends."
258;1184570;1185990;"Nor do you need friends."
259;1187000;1193260;"You should just listen to Dad and me, 
and do your job as you always have."
260;1193960;1195710;"When the time comes,"
261;1195710;1198010;"I'll tell you to take the Hunter Exam."
262;1198680;1200230;"You don't need a license yet."
263;1200920;1203560;"After that, he was reduced 
to a shell of himself."
264;1204850;1207930;"Leorio and Kurapika tried to help,"
265;1207930;1210020;"but he wouldn't respond."
266;1210770;1214020;"The sixth match was between 
Leorio and Bodoro."
267;1214640;1218320;"Bodoro had recovered, 
but when the match began..."
268;1218790;1219650;"Begin!"
269;1245420;1247140;"It was over in a second."
270;1247470;1250770;"Killua had killed Bodoro."
271;1251310;1255150;"{\fad(1,688)}The committee disqualified him."
272;1256420;1257230;"Gon-kun!"
273;1257550;1259050;"Where is everyone?"
274;1259600;1262240;"You need more rest, Gon-kun..."
275;1286270;1287510;"Gon."
276;1299340;1301150;"Apologize to Killua!"
