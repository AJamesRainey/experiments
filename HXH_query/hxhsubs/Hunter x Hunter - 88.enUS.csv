1;1670;3850;"Given his personality,"
2;3850;7000;"he's probably already warmed 
to these opponents..."
3;8080;10110;"I doubt he'd sell me out,"
4;10350;14520;"but it's probable that he'll accidentally 
say something he shouldn't."
5;15440;18740;"My chance will come after they leave."
6;20310;23210;"I will defeat them..."
7;103990;109000;"Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness"
8;128270;131110;"The man targeting Gon and Killua"
9;132060;134470;"is named Shoot McMahon."
10;134990;138400;"He, too, is one of Morel's students."
11;141690;142490;"This won't work."
12;143700;147210;"In our current condition, 
we don't stand a chance..."
13;148160;149270;"Yeah."
14;149270;154690;"I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using 
less than half of his strength."
15;155350;156630;"Probably so."
16;157240;160430;"But we have to fight him."
17;160430;161470;"Yeah..."
18;162550;165000;"I don't sense anyone else around."
19;165000;166390;"It's the perfect chance."
20;167980;171900;"When I take my target down, I am 
always deliberate and thorough."
21;172810;175330;"That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter."
22;190670;192970;"Here we go... This is my chance."
23;194420;196180;"What's wrong?"
24;196180;198190;"It's the perfect opportunity."
25;198190;199670;"Right now, I can easily..."
26;205670;206560;"Go..."
27;209100;210050;"Go!"
28;226880;228620;"Shoot McMahon..."
29;230100;232900;"He is a coward."
30;239280;240950;"Hey, Killua..."
31;240950;243220;"Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?"
32;243220;245010;"Hmm? What do you mean?"
33;245010;247160;"Why didn't they let him go to NGL?"
34;247160;249480;"He seems really strong to me."
35;249800;251100;"Well, that's true."
36;251630;256710;"In terms of physical ability, 
he'd be a match for Kite."
37;256710;258360;"It's probably a mental thing."
38;258710;260020;"Mental?"
39;260530;264550;"His approach isn't in line 
with this mission's objective."
40;264550;265490;"He's too soft."
41;266440;269290;"And he gets attached to animals too easily."
42;269630;273750;"And he did end up volunteering 
to help us, somehow..."
43;274970;278130;"And the number of dogs around keeps increasing."
44;278130;279110;"Yeah..."
45;285290;289850;"<i>They can maintain their</i> Ren <i>for two hours 
without having to really concentrate.</i>"
46;289850;291980;"That's a good sign..."
47;291980;294420;"If they can do it for three hours,"
48;294420;297690;"I might consider letting them fight 
Knuckle when they're fully rested."
49;299190;303690;"Knuckle will then be forced 
to use his full strength."
50;304390;306970;"I hope it will be enough to teach them..."
51;307700;310950;"That which they lack, that which they need."
52;311700;314200;"But that still only takes them halfway."
53;314200;319300;"If everything goes well, it'll take them 
about ten days to reach that point."
54;320240;325130;"And that means they'll have no more 
than a day left before time's up..."
55;325130;327120;"I'm not sure they can make it."
56;351370;354480;"I should probably prepare for my escape..."
57;354480;356160;"Save my own skin."
58;359430;361150;"Help yourself."
59;361150;362880;"Thanks!"
60;367460;368370;"Yum!"
61;369470;370640;"What do you think?"
62;371030;373730;"Oh, this is really good!"
63;373730;375430;"Not that!"
64;375430;377120;"We only have ten days."
65;377120;377640;"Huh?"
66;377920;379390;"From what I've seen,"
67;379390;382050;"you're only two-thirds through your training"
68;382050;384850;"to become strong enough"
69;384850;388530;"to force Knuckle into using his full strength..."
70;389110;390430;"Uh-oh..."
71;390430;392530;"She knows exactly what's going on."
72;392530;394790;"Huh? Is that true, Bisky?"
73;397760;399340;"But it'll be fine!"
74;399340;402020;"We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!"
75;403420;405800;"How can you be so sure?!"
76;406130;409300;"The situation hasn't improved at all..."
77;411760;416770;"You said it was all right for 
me to speak up, so I will."
78;416770;419690;"You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!"
79;419690;422070;"They didn't give you enough time..."
80;422070;425240;"Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife,"
81;425240;428610;"staring at it to calm myself."
82;428610;431520;"That means I'm nearly over the edge,"
83;431520;436290;"so if you run at once, before it's too late, 
I probably won't try to chase and kill you."
84;437090;438640;"If not for her outbursts..."
85;438640;442290;"This would be a pleasant meal..."
86;442690;444410;"We aren't gonna run away."
87;444410;445790;"How many times do I have to say it?"
88;446470;448960;"What else can you do?"
89;448960;452430;"As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!"
90;453510;454550;"We'll win!"
91;455300;456310;"Pinky swear."
92;457600;459480;"Come on... Hurry up!"
93;460950;467190;"I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle 
and Shoot before the deadline."
94;467610;472010;"If I break my promise, I have to 
swallow a thousand needles..."
95;472010;473740;"Pinky sworn!"
96;475280;477700;"On the island I'm from, there's another part."
97;478220;481190;"You go like this and put your thumbs together."
98;482090;484580;"Sealed with a kiss!"
99;486950;488980;"Okay, now it's a promise."
100;489560;492950;"By the way, Palm-san, 
what did you use to flavor this?"
101;492950;496600;"Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones..."
102;497300;502010;"Gon's getting really good at handling Palm."
103;503460;508230;"I suspect she's the one leading 
things in that direction..."
104;508370;512110;"I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight,"
105;512110;514290;"then I let it sit for another night."
106;514800;516740;"Ten days left."
107;517120;519150;"Don't say that like a countdown to our death!"
108;534940;536010;"This is it..."
109;537880;540900;"Smoke that covers the forest like fog."
110;542930;544450;"Baital squad here."
111;544450;546270;"Goran, give me an update."
112;547720;549490;"Goran, do you read me?"
113;549900;550770;"Goran!"
114;551400;554470;"Could they have already taken him out?"
115;555270;557330;"Anyone from Goran's squad out there?"
116;557330;559350;"Give me a report!"
117;559350;560250;"Hey..."
118;560250;563900;"We can't see anything with all this smoke..."
119;563900;567060;"We've been trying to reach Squadron 
Leader Goran, but he won't respond!"
120;564290;566110;"{\an8}Any sign of the leader?"
121;566110;568970;"{\an8}I can't see the guy in front 
of me! What's going on?!"
122;567060;568970;"I've lost contact with him!"
123;568970;570940;"He was right beside me a moment ago!"
124;569640;571650;"{\an8}I can't see a thing!"
125;570940;573140;"He just vanished into the smoke!"
126;571650;574500;"{\an8}Yah! There's a hole!"
127;576710;579510;"With all these messages, 
I can't tell what's happening..."
128;579510;583430;"They should've established a communication 
network to operate in the leader's absence."
129;584360;586010;"Baital squad, forward!"
130;586470;588690;"Find Goran's squadron and converge with them."
131;590480;594810;"Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act 
as rearguard for the Baital squad!"
132;596310;598520;"Proceed in a V formation!"
133;611700;614810;"The number of soldiers is dropping."
134;616430;619030;"What's happening?"
135;620750;621720;"Now."
136;624940;626590;"Hey, Baital?"
137;641430;643870;"So you're next?"
138;653060;655770;"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
139;656280;657380;"What do you mean?"
140;658190;660480;"All we do is send enemies to the old man."
141;660480;662440;"He's the one who takes them out."
142;662980;665430;"This is a little too easy."
143;665430;667390;"But it is a surefire method."
144;667810;668890;"Can't argue there."
145;669740;671650;"The Chairman was being modest..."
146;671650;674530;"He's still much stronger than we are."
147;675050;677350;"And he seems rather excited about this."
148;680450;682910;"Oh, speak of the devil."
149;685370;687780;"Keep sending them my way."
150;688230;691030;"I'm finally starting to regain my touch."
151;691940;693790;"Impressive..."
152;696080;698120;"And how about the Queen?"
153;698820;701050;"She hasn't made a move."
154;701740;704680;"The Queen is still holed up in her nest."
155;705600;709680;"Then the King hasn't been born yet."
156;710680;714190;"Continue to monitor the situation."
157;714600;716030;"Roger that."
158;716820;719550;"The old man's on a roll."
159;719550;721890;"Shall we grab another squadron?"
160;721890;722870;"Yeah."
161;730610;733460;"Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned."
162;734150;736330;"We're down to fourteen squadrons."
163;737190;738820;"Damned humans."
164;738820;742500;"How are they managing to whittle us down?"
165;742920;744240;"I don't know."
166;744240;749310;"All I know is that there are some 
humans who are very strong."
167;750770;754420;"We know too little about humans."
168;754970;759230;"They appear to possess a variety 
of powers far stronger than ours."
169;759690;764240;"Had we more time, we could 
obtain that power, as well."
170;765550;769080;"However, once the King is born, 
we will hold the advantage."
171;769080;771500;"Yes, I hope that will be the case."
172;783550;785360;"You want to come out?"
173;788340;789810;"Not yet."
174;791160;793480;"It's still too early."
175;799290;801070;"Okay, that's three hours!"
176;801600;803710;"Oh? Already?"
177;803710;805890;"That seemed fast."
178;805890;808700;"Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break."
179;808700;809840;"Huh?"
180;809840;811450;"Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?"
181;812290;815170;"You can go once you're rested."
182;815910;816830;"Defeat him."
183;818680;822590;"You have a little over a day 
before the Chairman's deadline."
184;823290;825720;"This may be your first and last chance."
185;829590;835350;"Well, if they're able to fight at full strength, 
they'll have to accept the results, win or lose."
186;835820;838360;"If they can each identify what they're missing,"
187;838360;841140;"then this training was a success."
188;858200;861390;"Now, the problem is figuring out my escape..."
189;894830;896910;"Seems you kids are serious tonight."
190;1000790;1002770;"Morning, Youpi."
191;1007010;1008270;"Youpi?"
192;1009030;1014030;"To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi."
193;1016600;1018630;"I'm hungry."
194;1025410;1029040;"Before we begin, I want to 
know where your partner is."
195;1029500;1032060;"Eh? You mean Shoot?"
196;1032060;1032950;"Yeah."
197;1033350;1035680;"Why do you want to know that?"
198;1035680;1038180;"You're about to get the crap knocked out of you."
199;1038880;1041270;"We need both tokens."
200;1041270;1043450;"That's a riot!"
201;1043450;1046060;"If you defeat me, I'll tell you."
202;1046810;1048740;"We might not get a chance to ask you then."
203;1049130;1050820;"You might be out cold."
204;1055360;1058070;"You're no longer amusing me..."
205;1078570;1079600;"There!"
206;1082150;1082850;"Gon!"
207;1086390;1087760;"That hit hard."
208;1087760;1090260;"I could feel the impact 
throughout my entire body."
209;1090750;1094660;"<i>If I drop my</i> Ken, <i>his next 
punch will knock me out.</i>"
210;1095470;1098000;"After another four or five warm-up punches,"
211;1098000;1099660;"I'll get serious..."
212;1099660;1102080;"Better watch yourself."
213;1103500;1105830;"I warm up fast."
214;1109570;1111860;"Still no one coming out today?"
215;1111860;1112880;"No."
216;1115040;1118510;"As expected, they've holed up inside."
217;1119260;1120890;"Shall we make our move?"
218;1121610;1125190;"No, we're approaching the 
deadline for your disciples."
219;1125930;1127640;"We can wait until that's over."
220;1128400;1132910;"Judging by the estimated number of 
bodies currently stored in the nest,"
221;1132910;1136300;"they'll need to replenish in a week or so."
222;1136920;1139150;"I would like to dispatch another"
223;1139150;1141540;"two or three squadrons at that time."
224;1142300;1144270;"Okay, I'll leave it in your hands."
225;1150490;1153740;"We don't move until we know 
how our disciples performed."
226;1155630;1157170;"I think it's a waste of time..."
227;1158170;1160380;"Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help,"
228;1160380;1163990;"but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable."
229;1164540;1167050;"We can't count on them for anything in a fight."
230;1167050;1170190;"At best, they could act as decoys."
231;1171180;1173740;"Hell, they'd probably get in our way..."
232;1174180;1176470;"I'm certain of it."
233;1176860;1180570;"That old man always was a gambler..."
234;1181300;1185500;"Want to bet whose disciples 
will show up tomorrow?"
235;1186790;1190030;"I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot."
236;1190580;1193580;"If we're both wrong, 
the Chairman gets the money."
237;1194820;1195840;"How about it?"
238;1197460;1198800;"Sure."
239;1199480;1201090;"Then, I'll put..."
240;1204080;1205590;"...1,000,000 on them."
241;1205590;1209700;"Huh? That's just impossible!"
242;1209700;1212540;"Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?"
243;1213060;1214860;"The Chairman is a dog?"
244;1216180;1218360;"I happen to love gambling."
245;1218850;1221530;"I always roll high..."
246;1229370;1230370;"There!"
247;1232470;1233960;"Behind you, fool!"
248;1251240;1252950;"He's still warming up?"
249;1253320;1255270;"Damn, he's strong!"
250;1255720;1257450;"But why is Knuckle..."
251;1257950;1258950;"Could it be..."
252;1258950;1263760;"Hey, aren't you going to use 
that "First comes rock" thing?"
253;1264820;1267510;"Well, you won't be able to use that technique."
254;1267510;1270130;"It's flawed, after all."
255;1271530;1273040;"It's flawed?"
256;1273640;1275260;"A word of advice..."
257;1275260;1278920;"If you try that technique, 
I'll stop you in your tracks."
258;1282310;1285810;"In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it."
259;1289280;1291270;"Your technique"
260;1291270;1294510;"has two huge weaknesses!"
261;1309190;1312670;"I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission"
262;1313560;1316960;"without sacrificing someone..."
263;1406040;1408500;"Next time: Compassion x And x Strength."
264;1408500;1410630;"And love and sorrow!"
265;1410630;1412900;"And reassurance..."
266;1412900;1414260;"No biggie!"
