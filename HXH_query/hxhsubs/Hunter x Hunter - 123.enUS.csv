7;30380;34800;"My subordinates were present at the 
moment of your mother's passing."
8;37630;41010;"She uttered your name with her dying breath."

fighting your Royal Guard by now."
10;54110;56380;"Interested in fighting me now?"
11;59950;63720;"If you can force me to admit defeat,"
12;63720;66240;"I will tell you your name."
13;69130;73310;"Force you to admit defeat without killing you?"

30;345190;346150;"Why?"
31;346580;347530;"Don't move!"
32;352080;353830;"If you move, I'll attack."

34;360270;363840;"I have a lot of things to ask you."
35;363840;365840;"If you seem to be trying anything funny,"

37;369230;371440;"What he wants to ask me"
38;372150;373050;"is obvious!"
39;374170;375450;"The number of my allies,"
40;375900;376960;"their roles,"
41;377680;379100;"and their abilities."
42;379860;383360;"And he intends to use any means 
necessary to get the answers."
43;384570;388490;"People could die if I leak information."
44;389750;391350;"If he's a Manipulator,"
45;391990;394780;"he can obtain the information against my will."
46;397880;398580;"Huh?"
47;398950;400250;"D-Don't move!"
48;400250;401500;"I really will kill you!"
49;401650;403420;"Go ahead... Kill me."
50;403420;404250;"That's what I want!"
51;404740;405750;"Stop!"
52;405750;407760;"If the alternative is betraying my buddies,"
53;408320;409210;"I'll take you with me!"
54;409880;411570;"Ouch!"
55;412150;413890;"Bastard! Now you've done it!"
56;414870;415890;"Damn it!"
57;416200;417360;"I'll kill you!"
58;417680;418760;"Missile Man!"
59;426780;428530;"I'm... not dead..."
60;429630;430930;"I didn't sustain any damage."
61;431650;433950;"What was that attack?"
62;434210;437200;"Damn, that hurts..."
63;437680;439420;"You little punk..."
64;439420;441960;"Damn..."
65;442550;448210;"That bastard... How did a wimp like 
that figure out my weakness?"
66;448680;451620;"Missile Man requires questions and answers to work."
67;451620;455860;"If an enemy attacks before I can ask 
a question, it's null and void!"
68;456690;458110;"The wound isn't deep..."
69;461100;463530;"I'll take my time beating him to a pulp."
70;470150;470850;"Huh?"
71;481470;484750;"He planted something inside me?"
72;486850;490830;"Those were created by my <i>Nen</i>."
73;491330;492630;"They're black centipedes."
74;493550;495630;"{\fad(861,1)}Black Centipede"
75;496550;500140;"They grow by feeding on your resistance."
76;507190;512450;"If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,"
77;513050;515910;"you'll suffer excruciating pain,"
78;516310;519570;"then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!"
79;528670;530950;"Wh-What are you doing, fool?"
80;530950;532900;"Weren't you listening to me?"
81;533280;536240;"If you try to do that..."
82;545000;546790;"That's fine with me."
83;548010;550100;"If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!"
84;555040;556570;"S-Stop!"
85;564320;565830;"No, wait..."
86;566660;570860;"If he wanted to kill me, that's the 
ultimate form of resistance."
87;571690;576850;"Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes 
to grow large enough to kill him instantly!"
88;583820;585260;"Don't worry."
89;585780;587260;"I'm not interested in killing you..."
90;588320;591490;"I just need to make sure that you can't leave."
91;594340;595480;"I still..."
92;596050;597110;"have plenty of bullets."
93;600930;602870;"Bastard! Don't mess with me!"
94;603260;604620;"I'll kill you!"
95;604620;607020;"You're dead! I'll kill you!"
96;631980;633710;"It's so easy."
97;639760;642660;"When I'm prepared to offer my own life,"
98;643360;647480;"it's so easy to pull the trigger."
99;688810;690000;"I g-get it..."
100;690000;691080;"I get it, already."
101;691080;692540;"I won't go anywhere!"
102;695290;696260;"I surrender."
103;696260;698300;"Please... Don't fire!"
104;702550;704440;"The pain is going away."
105;704440;706570;"The creatures inside me are suffering?"
106;707470;709810;"I lose, damn it..."
107;710970;713310;"I can't move anymore."
108;714630;717910;"Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?"
109;723040;725760;"Man, I knew it..."
110;726280;728780;"I had a feeling this would happen eventually."
111;730670;732350;"But still..."
112;732350;735740;"I didn't think I was this weak!"
113;735740;739480;"I didn't think it'd be so scary 
to face someone who fights"
114;739480;741970;"with no regard for their own life!"
115;743470;744310;"Hey."
116;744680;745620;"What?"
117;746230;750850;"The pain has stopped, but can 
you get rid of these bugs?"
118;752070;753800;"Stop complaining..."
119;753800;756970;"I'm in too much pain to think about that now!"
120;763890;765340;"Hurry up."
121;765770;767870;"Give me a minute!"
122;768800;772990;"I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man."
123;773490;777050;"But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble..."
124;777560;780130;"Damn, how do I get out of this?"
125;783690;785480;"I need to buy time..."
126;785820;788300;"Until I can come up with a good idea."
127;791800;794830;"The pain is making me..."
128;795400;797850;"feel faint..."
129;819030;820370;"Wait! Okay!"
130;820370;822470;"I was lying! I won't do it again!"
131;822470;824540;"Then get rid of these."
132;824840;826900;"Yeah, uh..."
133;826900;829430;"So, the thing is..."
134;835950;838270;"Forget it. I see how it is."
135;838760;840310;"Wait! Hold on!"
136;840680;842900;"I can't remove them!"
137;842900;844570;"Not once they've been activated!"
138;848000;850490;"That's why I didn't want to say anything."
139;850490;853010;"It's the truth! Believe me!"
140;853010;854830;"I'm not trying to trick you!"
141;856980;859440;"The insects are in pain again."
142;860270;862380;"Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?"
143;863190;864790;"Can you really blame me?"
144;865590;869030;"I only use this attack when I want to kill someone."
145;869030;870840;"I never cared what happened after that."
146;871520;876350;"I never gave any thought to 
what happened to my enemy."
147;877720;880680;"<i>Nen</i> abilities are really something."
148;881150;884610;"My abilities reflect my own personality."
149;885570;889760;"My personality? His true intentions?"
150;891270;892220;"Welfin..."
151;895020;896570;"What do I ask him?"
152;897310;898800;"What do I want to know?"
153;903100;905470;"I once knew someone just like him."
154;907740;911090;"Do you have any memories from 
when you were human?"
155;911580;914600;"Wh-Why are you asking about that?"
156;915140;916790;"I can't remember..."
157;920980;922150;"You're lying."
158;923270;924470;"Wh-What?"
159;924470;926240;"Stop! Hold on!"
160;926240;927030;"Calm down!"
161;928330;931710;"If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you."
162;942120;944440;"When I woke up,"
163;945520;947520;"my first thought was..."
164;953400;954900;"Damn..."
165;955680;958600;"I can still remember it."
166;968270;972760;"I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL."
167;983210;988780;"I was fed to the Queen, 
and reborn as something new..."
168;992750;993840;"But I still..."
169;994920;999970;"I still remember the one thing 
I most wanted to forget."
170;1004920;1007280;"The sight of my father strangling me,"
171;1008660;1011040;"and the woman watching behind him."
172;1016000;1019500;"At first, I only had flashbacks of it."
173;1020270;1023370;"Over time, I remembered the 
entire sequence of events."
174;1028100;1030130;"I was saved by..."
175;1031200;1033990;"my little brother, who was unrelated by blood."
176;1037830;1039140;"I remember now!"
177;1040080;1043260;"He looked just like Gyro!"
178;1044560;1045530;"Gyro?"
179;1046230;1048520;"You know. The king!"
180;1051640;1055600;"We used to brag about whose 
life was more miserable."
181;1057130;1060810;"He was the only one I could 
turn to when I needed"
182;1060810;1062540;"to laugh away my tears..."
183;1063930;1066810;"We were both empty."
184;1067850;1071470;"So we had nothing to hide."
185;1077460;1080730;"I wonder what he's doing now..."
186;1090720;1094570;"I want to see him one more time..."
187;1116300;1119560;"Yes, I just want to see Gyro."
188;1121390;1124250;"I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,"
189;1125100;1128730;"with money and nations..."
190;1133070;1134200;"Go."
191;1134910;1136540;"The bugs are gone."
192;1137280;1139610;"You still have something to do."
193;1142560;1145620;"Why did you open the doors?"
194;1147210;1152380;"Oh, I was letting those weaklings 
reach the treasure in the back."
195;1156250;1158600;"They can't put up much of a fight."
196;1159830;1162310;"I was watching you and Bro on the monitor."
197;1163760;1166890;"And I told them to pass while 
you were on the way back."
198;1177840;1179630;"A coward!"
199;1181900;1183280;"It was that simple."
200;1186060;1188910;"Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,"
201;1189390;1191920;"{\fad(1,479)}I thought you'd be an easy target."
202;1192620;1194890;"I couldn't have been more wrong."
203;1200940;1202140;"Go on."
204;1202650;1204260;"I'm too tired to move..."
205;1204920;1206420;"I have one last question."
206;1208060;1210930;"Did you see a woman in the palace?"
207;1211360;1212420;"A woman?"
208;1213840;1216350;"Not sure if it's the one you're talking about,"
209;1216350;1220840;"but the Royal Guard captured a human, 
and put her in a cocoon."
210;1221590;1222950;"Where is she?"
211;1224000;1226410;"Take the elevator up, then turn left."
212;1226910;1228450;"It's the room at the end of the hall."
213;1229620;1231690;"They called it #1."
214;1233130;1234120;"Thank you!"
215;1238670;1239960;"What's so funny?"
216;1244920;1247220;"Telling the truth"
217;1248170;1250930;"feels really good..."
218;1255730;1260990;"Welfin had spent his life unable 
to trust himself or others."
219;1261890;1266820;"Telling Ikalgo the location of 
the one he searched for"
220;1267470;1271950;"was the first time he'd opened 
up and spoken honestly."
221;1404610;1406840;"Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening."
222;1408250;1410970;"I'm just... I'm just..."
223;1410970;1412670;"What's wrong, Killua?"
224;1412670;1413890;"I'm here for you."
