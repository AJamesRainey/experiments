45;235840;239410;"Once you have your number, add four,"

57;276950;278130;"Seriously?"
58;278690;280000;"This is very strange..."
59;280000;281260;"Insane!"
60;281260;283050;"A satanic magic trick!"
61;283050;286770;"And he's incorporated his own

62;288400;291890;"Why is he so calm?"
63;291890;293660;"The trick is worth no points."
64;293660;295890;"That had no effect on the match,"

67;301480;303280;"You may keep this as a souvenir."
68;304670;306060;"Scumbag."
69;306060;308160;"I will sever your left arm,"

77;334080;335090;"What?"
78;338780;342150;"As expected, you attacked with your double."
79;342150;347230;"Had you, yourself, attacked, 
I would have countered."
80;349270;350950;"With this."
81;352280;356950;"Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!"
82;359920;362160;"This is another magic trick."
83;362160;365210;"Can you guess the secret behind it?"
84;365420;366610;"He's lying..."
85;366610;370190;"He's obviously employing Nen 
to accomplish this feat."
86;371120;374340;"But what type of Nen is he using?"
87;377550;378920;"What's wrong?"
88;378920;380600;"Are you frightened?"
89;381220;383560;"You're surprised because you 
don't understand my trick."
90;384690;386860;"That's how magic works."
91;387280;390560;"Your power to create a double 
is certainly magnificent."
92;390560;392870;"But now I understand your ability."
93;393930;398250;"I can also anticipate how you 
will attack with your double."
94;398250;400870;"And I know how to counter that attack."
95;401280;403220;"It's quite unfortunate."
96;405120;408190;"You have the talent to 
become a skilled opponent."
97;409310;412700;"That was why I spared your life."
98;414270;416120;"Here is a prediction..."
99;416120;418890;"You will die, in a frenzied dance."
100;421480;423650;"Silence!"
101;428450;430530;"H-How did he pick me out?"
102;430910;435700;"Doubles are created in the original's image,"
103;436160;437790;"so they tend to be pristine."
104;438540;442660;"But you can't recreate every 
effect of an ongoing battle."
105;444460;445670;"Oh?"
106;446250;448340;"Did you not realize this?"
107;461620;464350;"What is going on here?"
108;464350;468030;"This sequence of events is 
impossible to understand!"
109;468030;470740;"Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?"
110;471380;472720;"Don't bother."
111;472720;475360;"I hit you in the chin,"
112;475360;478240;"so you'll have difficulty moving for a while."
113;478600;482250;"Meaning that you won't be able 
to evade my next attack."
114;485410;486520;"What?"
115;487050;489250;"Where did this attack come from?"
116;489880;492100;"No, I don't have time for that..."
117;492100;493720;"I must use a double to block the cards!"
118;493720;496220;"You can't create another double."
119;498010;502710;"You need intense focus to 
create a double with <i>Nen</i>."
120;504650;509650;"The only reason you were able 
to use doubles freely"
121;511020;513610;"was because you had a normal state of mind."
122;517420;520700;"Using <i>Nen</i> to replicate and manipulate"
123;521450;523830;"something as complex as a human being"
124;524940;526960;"is extremely difficult."
125;528350;530650;"Just how difficult is it?"
126;530650;532980;"By the time you've learned to use a double,"
127;532980;536930;"you've forgotten how to use 
<i>Nen</i> for anything else."
128;536930;541930;"I call that running out of memory."
129;544320;548250;"You lost because you wasted memory space."
130;554840;557080;"Kastro can no longer stand!"
131;557080;560110;"Hisoka wins by knockout!"
132;565390;566530;"Hisoka..."
133;580950;582390;"Good work."
134;584710;587530;"Now, show me that injury."
135;597800;599730;"I was never absolutely certain,"
136;599730;602120;"but today's match confirmed it."
137;603180;604770;"You are an idiot."
138;606230;607620;"Perhaps."
139;608230;611650;"Why do you endanger yourself this way?"
140;611650;614630;"Was that meant as a 
performance or something?"
141;614980;615930;"Who knows?"
142;619270;622640;"Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid."
143;631560;633650;"I'll stop your bleeding first."
144;638640;640040;"Hey, hey."
145;640040;642190;"Please try to be gentle."
146;642190;645040;"Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura."
147;654630;656360;"I'll start with the left arm."
148;661550;662680;"Here I go."

153;679240;681570;"Basically, it's one hundred percent connected."
154;686640;688160;"An excellent job."
155;688650;689960;"Next,"
156;689960;691290;"I'll do your right arm."
157;691780;693960;"Hold it yourself this time."
158;701260;703760;"I'm always mesmerized by your skill."
159;708040;711650;"Perhaps I get myself injured"
160;711650;714440;"so I can watch you work your magic."
161;714800;715930;"Right."
162;715930;717320;"Twenty million for the left arm."
163;717320;718700;"Fifty million for the right."
164;718700;721440;"Pay up. Now."
165;721440;724030;"I'll send the money to your account."
166;724030;725250;"All right."
167;725830;728840;"You can treat the rest of 
your injuries yourself."
168;728840;730950;"You could provide better service."
169;731560;734760;"You should be able to manage 
with your Bungee Gum"
170;734760;736460;"and Texture Surprise."
171;737060;738250;"Oh..."
172;738250;740460;"I should probably conceal this."
173;740460;741470;"That way,"
174;742050;745690;"they'll think my arms were 
healed during the match."
175;748320;751980;"This is an ordinary scarf, 
with no special features."
176;753270;754480;"I use Bungee Gum"
177;754980;756850;"to attach it to my arm."
178;756850;760480;"Then I use Texture Surprise 
to create a layer of skin."
179;763000;763990;"He's so fast..."
180;764980;767680;"That was fast enough to fool a </i>Nen<i> master"
181;767680;769970;"into believing the arm had actually healed,"
182;769970;772500;"before he even knew what was happening."
183;773640;775500;"Next, I'll do the left."
184;776380;778010;"Bungee Gum..."
185;777580;783510;"{\an8\fad(489,1)}Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)"
186;778690;780720;"He molds his aura into a substance"
187;780720;783510;"with the properties of rubber and gum."
188;783890;786620;"It can stretch, swiftly contract,"
189;786620;789450;"adhere to most substances,"
190;789450;791520;"and be removed at any time."
191;792150;796520;"By the way, I call this Bungee Gum 
because when I was a child,"
192;796520;799520;"that was the name of my 
favorite chewing gum."
193;800260;802530;"I didn't need to know that."
194;804090;806030;"Texture Surprise..."
195;806050;814040;"{\an8\fad(923,1)}Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)"
196;806620;809460;"He combines aura with the power of his imagination,"
197;809460;811500;"to reproduce the appearance of skin."
198;812210;816770;"Essentially, it's a high-quality copy, 
so you can tell it's fake if you touch it."
199;817460;820540;"However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill..."
200;821220;824080;"The name Texture Surprise 
comes from the stickers"
201;824080;827470;"that were included with a popular snack"
202;827470;829300;"a while back."
203;829750;832310;"Like I said, I didn't need to know that."
204;832860;836740;"But weren't you impressed by my application"
205;837320;839500;"of these two abilities during the fight?"
206;839500;840380;"Huh?"
207;840870;843320;"You saw everything, didn't you?"
208;843760;845960;"Well, yeah..."
209;848050;849500;"As a distraction,"
210;849500;852680;"you sent thirteen cards flying into the air,"
211;852680;856330;"while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd"
212;856330;860280;"stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum."
213;861990;864840;"The aura from each was also tied"
214;865170;867340;"to your right arm."
215;868230;871910;"Additionally, you connected aura to 
the thirteen cards on the floor,"
216;872870;877600;"and held the ends with your left hand."
217;878290;879600;"Then,"
218;879600;882020;"when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,"
219;883040;884900;"You may keep this as a souvenir."
220;885340;888420;"the aura in your left hand was released."
221;889240;890400;"And connected."
222;891350;895910;"The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro."
223;896450;900170;"But Kastro never noticed."
224;900670;903270;"You employed one of the basic techniques,"
225;903270;907640;"<i>Zetsu</i>, to help mask your aura."
226;908330;910930;"However, there was a flaw..."
227;911410;914870;"Yes, someone trained in <i>Ren</i>,"
228;914870;917010;"another of the basic techniques,"
229;917010;919190;"could have focused the <i>Nen</i> in their eyes,"
230;919190;921870;"to see through your plan."
231;924130;925690;"That's why you"
232;925690;928690;"used that twisted magic trick 
to throw him off guard,"
233;929340;932700;"while you pretended to be 
reserving your strength."
234;933300;937650;"It even worked as camouflage, 
convincing him that your lack of aura"
235;937650;939570;"was a sign of confidence."
236;940280;944960;"After meticulously confirming 
that your plan was working,"
237;944960;947460;"you extended a thread of 
aura from your left hand,"
238;947460;951920;"the same one holding the cards, 
and connected it to Kastro's chin."
239;953410;955470;"Your preparations were now complete."
240;956100;958010;"You'd already used Texture Surprise"
241;958010;961730;"to alter the scarf on the floor 
to resemble human skin."
242;962810;963480;"And so,"
243;963920;966820;"when Kastro attacked your left arm,"
244;966820;968650;"you activated the Bungee Gum"
245;968650;970990;"between your right arm and 
the scarf on the floor."
246;972040;973770;"Your arm was restored,"
247;973770;976780;"and the scarf concealed the wound,"
248;976780;979500;"leaving everyone convinced that 
your right arm was restored."
249;980010;986030;"However, this performance actually 
helped Kastro to calm down."
250;986030;989420;"It made no sense for a severed arm"
251;989420;991510;"to reappear in a pristine state..."
252;992310;999520;"Kastro realized that I was 
using <i>Nen</i>, not magic."
253;999980;1004980;"But you didn't miss the subtle change 
in his psychological state."
254;1006180;1009500;"Your power to create a double 
is certainly magnificent."
255;1009500;1011530;"But now I understand your ability."
256;1012850;1017180;"I can also anticipate how you 
will attack with your double."
257;1017180;1019540;"And I know how to counter that attack."
258;1020150;1022070;"It's quite unfortunate."
259;1023970;1027540;"You have the talent to 
become a skilled opponent."
260;1028240;1031780;"That was why I spared your life."
261;1033750;1036680;"Kastro was about to recover."
262;1037010;1038110;"Here is a prediction..."
263;1038780;1041680;"You will die, in a frenzied dance."
264;1042670;1044680;"But then you pushed him over the edge."
265;1046720;1049190;"Silence!"
266;1050580;1052900;"H-How did he pick me out?"
267;1053430;1057570;"But you can't recreate every 
effect of an ongoing battle."
268;1061430;1066100;"You exposed the weakness of his doubles."
269;1066100;1070380;"But had he stayed composed, 
he had a fair chance."
270;1070750;1071420;"However..."
271;1072770;1075420;"Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain..."
272;1087040;1089100;"And he lost."
273;1090410;1094700;"You realize that those two abilities"
274;1094700;1096110;"are perfect for you."
275;1096800;1099670;"As opposed to Kastro's doubles,"
276;1099670;1101690;"if my opponent knows of my abilities,"
277;1101690;1105000;"I lose nothing because they're so adaptable."
278;1108150;1109000;"Well,"
279;1109490;1110910;"I'm off."
280;1110910;1111920;"Already?"
281;1112480;1114790;"My job is done, so I'm not sticking around."
282;1115400;1118130;"Since Nen Stitches can only do so much,"
283;1118130;1122010;"don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached."
284;1122700;1124210;"Oh, that's right."
285;1124670;1126020;"I came here for a reason."
286;1127630;1129480;"I have new orders."
287;1129920;1132330;"All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City"
288;1132330;1137010;"by noon, August 30th, not just 
those who find it convenient."
289;1137570;1139530;"Will the boss be coming?"
290;1140120;1141530;"Most likely."
291;1142080;1144810;"This could be our biggest job yet."
292;1145400;1146990;"If you skip this one,"
293;1146990;1149850;"the boss might hunt you down himself."
294;1149850;1151910;"How very scary."
295;1151910;1155050;"Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?"
296;1158140;1159550;"A pity."
297;1167870;1170700;"Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?"
298;1171040;1173980;"It was boring."
299;1179590;1181570;"Did Hisoka win?"
300;1185350;1186580;"I was lying."
301;1188270;1190580;"It was an incredible fight."
302;1191090;1195590;"I hate to admit this, but I have 
no idea how Hisoka won."
303;1197200;1199410;"You couldn't tell?"
304;1199950;1200590;"Gon,"
305;1201610;1205100;"we need to learn more about <i>Nen</i>."
306;1207070;1208180;"Yeah!"
307;1226160;1227870;"He doesn't talk."
308;1231910;1234240;"He doesn't talk about the past."
309;1235130;1237380;"He has no interest in the past."
310;1238390;1242880;"By tomorrow, I imagine he'll 
have forgotten Kastro's face."
311;1245120;1246890;"He doesn't associate with others."
312;1249880;1253190;"He's his own man."
313;1253670;1255650;"Because he believes himself"
314;1256030;1257580;"to be the strongest."
315;1271120;1274130;"Oh, I forgot to remove this."
316;1278400;1279640;"Spider..."
317;1281880;1284740;"I found some new toys to play with."
318;1286610;1288820;"I suppose it's time to start the hunt."
319;1298090;1301150;"Hisoka has been masquerading 
as a Phantom Troupe member."
320;1301780;1307020;"To him, the Phantom Troupe 
is simply another target."
321;1381110;1386150;"Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit"
322;1381110;1386610;"Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia"
323;1381400;1382950;"Coming up, we have Gon"
324;1382950;1383650;"and Killua's"
325;1383650;1385300;"Hunterpedia!"
326;1386620;1387470;"It's Gon"
327;1387470;1388320;"and Killua's"
328;1388320;1389610;"Hunterpedia!"
329;1388650;1398910;"Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia"
330;1389610;1391530;"Today, we introduce Kastro."
331;1391010;1393740;"A 200s-class warrior."
332;1391530;1392790;"He can use the Tiger Bite Fist."
333;1392790;1394610;"He can create a clone of himself with <i>Nen</i>."
334;1393740;1397500;"Combines release and 
incarnation techniques,"
335;1394610;1396150;"Doubles are tough to deal with."
336;1396150;1398770;"With this double, I can use the real Tiger Bite Fist!"
337;1397500;1399830;"to duplicate himself."
338;1398770;1400170;"The True Tiger Bite Fist!"
339;1404920;1407260;"Next time: An x Empty x Threat!"
340;1407260;1408170;"Ah... Ah..."
341;1408170;1409260;"Achoo!"
342;1409260;1410520;"Do I have a cold?"
343;1410520;1413080;"I bet someone's talking about you 
behind your back."
344;1413080;1414510;"Is it Mito-san?"
