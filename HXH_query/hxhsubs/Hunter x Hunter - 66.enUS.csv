have made it this far,"

to trim that number to about 300."

become a top Hunter..."

55;296170;297440;"Yay!"
56;298120;302030;"Sorry to interrupt your celebration, 
but look at these spell cards."
57;303690;305040;"Wow..."
58;305040;306990;"There's even an S-rank card!"
59;306990;309110;"How much can we sell it for?"
60;309110;312010;"Oh, let's go ask around!"
61;312010;314540;"No, we should use it wisely."
62;315050;316740;"So what should we do?"
63;316740;319110;"Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it."
64;319530;321190;"With all these defensive spells,"
65;321190;323300;"we don't need to worry 
about it getting stolen."
66;323960;325690;"Have you tried any of these?"
67;325690;327650;"Just Blackout Curtain."
68;327650;328780;"What?"
69;328780;330930;"If you have all these cards, 
you should use them..."

76;349440;351660;"Oh, I see a lot of names."
77;354840;355840;"Hey, Gon..."
78;355840;357560;"When did you run into him?"
79;357560;358450;"Huh?"
80;362250;365010;"Chrollo Lucilfer"
81;363660;364570;"Chrollo?"
82;365340;367120;"Who's Chrollo?"
83;367120;370210;"I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game."
84;370210;373050;"Does that mean you guys passed 
each other without noticing?"
85;373050;374640;"Huh? What are you talking about?"
86;374900;376260;"That doesn't make sense."
87;376260;379020;"Kurapika sealed his <i>Nen</i>."
88;379270;382900;"Yeah, and you have to use 
<i>Nen</i> to enter the game."
89;382900;384620;"Who's Kurapika?!"
90;384620;386320;"That only leaves..."
91;387600;389630;"Let me in on this!"
92;393110;395330;"I get it. So that's what's going on."
93;396910;398250;"Hey, Shal..."
94;398250;400430;"Stop laughing, and explain 
what this is about."
95;400430;401830;"Sorry about that."
96;401830;404710;"Chrollo Lucilfer"
97;403020;404710;"This probably isn't the boss."
98;405580;407840;"He hasn't purged the <i>Nen</i> from his body."
99;409030;410200;"Purging <i>Nen</i>?"
100;410200;411090;"It's very doable."
101;411090;412050;"Seriously?"
102;412050;413170;"Of course!"
103;413170;414960;"If you can place <i>Nen</i> on others,"
104;414960;417350;"it's not unreasonable to think 
<i>Nen</i> can be removed, as well."
105;417800;422100;"Does that mean Chrollo has removed 
Kurapika's <i>Nen</i>, and entered the game?"
106;422360;423860;"Why would he be here?"
107;423860;425500;"I'm not sure,"
108;425500;427670;"but we should probably let Kurapika know."
109;428310;430600;"I'll leave the game real quick."
110;430600;432740;"You can use a spell card to leave."
111;433570;434800;"Save it."
112;434800;436440;"I can be out and back in four hours."
113;438350;440240;"I should have realized this sooner..."
114;440500;445000;"Yorknew City                                        Greed Island"
115;441210;445000;"This island is directly east of Yorknew City."
116;447410;449340;"East is the direction to go."
117;449340;452190;"You will find one who awaits you."
118;452750;453800;"I see."
119;453800;456600;"So the boss came here to find 
someone to purge that <i>Nen</i>."
120;457450;460760;"The boss arrived the same way we did,"
121;460760;462260;"but then Razor kicked him out."
122;462260;464790;"That was when he realized 
this was Greed Island."
123;465300;467840;"But since the boss can't use <i>Nen</i>,"
124;467840;470400;"he can't enter the island 
via the usual channels."
125;470920;474160;"So he must have hired someone 
to come to this island for him."
126;474750;478750;"He had them use his name 
as a hidden message to us."
127;480660;484010;"The one who can purge this 
<i>Nen</i> is on Greed Island."
128;486060;488550;"Change in plans again..."
129;488820;490860;"Let's bring everyone else here."
130;490860;494290;"Yes, we'll all start looking 
for this <i>Nen</i> exorcist."
131;494290;496170;"I have a small correction."
132;499760;500990;"You're..."
133;500990;501900;"Hisoka!"
134;502820;506640;"It was my idea to use Chrollo's name."
135;507290;510690;"Because I didn't know you could 
enter any name you like"
136;510690;513710;"until I was already inside..."
137;514970;516390;"You should praise my initiative."
138;516790;520580;"Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message."
139;520940;523010;"Ah, so that's what this is about."
140;523490;526330;"I'm dying to kill you right here and now,"
141;526620;528260;"but I'll let the boss do that."
142;530060;533550;"Well, if anything comes up, 
use Contact to get in touch."
143;534070;537020;"If I learn anything new, I'll let you know."
144;538360;539280;"Bye."
145;542680;545230;"So the boss hired Hisoka..."
146;545640;547820;"He probably didn't have much 
choice, but it's still weird."
147;547820;551060;"And his reward is probably a duel, 
once the boss is cleansed."
148;551550;554150;"But now, it's only a matter of time"
149;556060;557810;"until the boss comes back!"
150;560430;561910;"I doubt it."
151;562280;563700;"I would know at once"
152;563700;568660;"if <i>Nen</i> I placed on a spider 
had been removed."
153;569250;573370;"So when you chose your power, you 
knew something like this might happen?"
154;573700;574810;"Of course..."
155;575140;577230;"If you're able to place <i>Nen</i> on others,"
156;577230;580350;"it only makes sense to assume"
157;580350;582810;"that one can also remove <i>Nen</i>."
158;584020;586500;"Well, now you know."
159;586500;588060;"What you do from here is up to you."
160;588450;590010;"Thanks for taking the trouble."
161;590330;591340;"You have my gratitude."
162;595690;596740;"Did you need anything?"
163;599410;601690;"What am I..."
164;602360;604430;"What am I supposed to do this month?"
165;605520;606570;"Tell me..."
166;607150;608950;"What should I do?"
167;609680;612150;"It'll be fine. Let me handle..."
168;612150;613710;"What could you possibly know?"
169;614270;617990;"You have no idea what's going 
to happen to us now!"
170;618610;619990;"Neon... I need Neon!"
171;619990;621800;"Restore Neon at once!"
172;624930;628020;"Damn! Why did this happen?"
173;631290;632870;"I wonder what's wrong..."
174;634920;637000;"Why did it stop working?"
175;639070;639990;"See ya."
176;643410;646430;"Looks like it's not the real Chrollo."
177;646430;647500;"Oh..."
178;647750;650380;"Kurapika was pretty calm about it."
179;650750;653460;"Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care."
180;654130;657010;"Well, it sounds like you 
got worried for nothing."
181;657010;660260;"Now it's time to focus on yourselves."
182;660540;661300;"Osu!"
183;661300;662800;"Start with the basics..."
184;663240;664760;"We're not going to train."

194;696390;697840;"Wow!"

202;716070;718280;"There is no such girl in this mansion."

263;856730;858210;"It's an SS-rank card."
264;858410;859680;"No way."
265;859680;862870;"I've already said I won't 
deal with you people."
266;862870;865020;"What if I throw in a Clone?"
267;865020;867720;"I'm telling you that there's no deal here."
268;868060;871030;"You already have ninety-two different cards."
269;871660;872930;"All that's left"
270;872930;875890;"are the cards monopolized 
by other players, yes?"
271;876870;880140;"Actually, we have ninety-five..."
272;880140;884110;"And you probably have many items 
that you haven't used Gain on yet."
273;884480;890490;"It's possible that Breath of Archangel 
is the final card you need."
274;891370;896440;"If we give that to you, we'll lose."
275;898140;899870;"Stop playing dumb."
276;900520;903010;"I know that you're monopolizing"
277;903010;907130;"both Breath of Archangel and Night Jade."
278;907130;909290;"This game isn't over yet."
279;909290;910130;"I see."
280;910520;912480;"Good luck, then."
281;912930;915420;"But we'll never let you have these cards."
282;915420;917390;"What if I offer three cards?"
283;917620;921110;"We'll give you Patch of Forest,"
284;918960;920670;"{\fad(417,1)}Patch of Forest 

The entrance to an enormous 
forest known as the Mountain 
God's Garden. Many species 
exist only in this forest. 
All are friendly to humans."

Upon entering and exiting hollow, 
player will be transported to a 
desolate location. However, player can 
return to original location 
without spending any money."

As the name implies, this dragon 
fits on your palm. Willingly obeys 
its master. If raised lovingly, 
it can learn to speak."
288;922870;924270;"and Palmtop Dragon."
289;925340;929280;"And you only have to give us Night Jade, 
not Breath of Archangel."
290;929860;933430;"We'd be giving you one SS-rank 
card and two S-rank cards,"
291;933430;935750;"while you'd only give up one A-rank card."
292;935750;937790;"I believe this deal is too good to pass up."
293;940010;941890;"Give us some time to discuss this."
294;942320;944370;"Just to be clear, this is our final offer."
295;944880;947110;"We won't accept any further negotiation."
296;947800;948500;"Book."
297;949990;951510;"It's gotta be a trap."
298;951510;953190;"That offer's too good."
299;953190;955620;"Tsezgerra is a careful man."
300;955620;957680;"He wouldn't try to pick a fight."
301;958030;961610;"But at the same time, he would 
never make a losing deal."
302;961870;966190;"{\fad(383,1)}Breath of Archangel 

An angel who can cure any mortal 
injury or terminal disease with one breath. 
However, angel will appear only once."
303;962020;963930;"Meaning that he thinks"
304;963930;966190;"he can obtain a Breath of Archangel."
305;966580;971110;"Does that mean they've assembled 
all forty spell card types?"
306;971360;972500;"It's possible."
307;972810;976200;"So they're waiting for Gain to be 
used on a Breath of Archangel."
308;976200;982710;"Night Jade 

A jewel blessed by the devil. 
When the holder is in danger, 
peril will be shifted to another."
309;976710;979050;"On the other hand, Night Jade is a card"
310;979050;980660;"that we monopolized through hard work."
311;981300;983500;"If one of the cards were to be destroyed,"
312;983500;986960;"one of our jade jewels would 
automatically turn into a card."
313;987850;992080;"Which means the A-rank 
Night Jade is much harder"

SS-rank Breath of Archangel."

320;1016260;1018430;"That was uneventful."
321;1018430;1020180;"Kind of disappointing."
322;1020560;1022100;"I was so nervous..."
323;1022760;1025250;"But now we've gathered 
seven types, in three days!"
324;1025740;1027450;"We're making decent progress."

331;1046200;1048000;"That's one in ten thousand tries."
332;1048000;1049540;"So it all comes down to luck."
333;1049900;1051230;"Pretty risky."

337;1056260;1058160;"If we get Good Luck, we can win!"
338;1058430;1060420;"But if you get Bad Luck,"
339;1060420;1062740;"something bad will happen that cancels out"

chance of getting Bad Luck."
342;1069720;1070470;"There!"
343;1071510;1073550;"Next, we try the slot machine!"

348;1083260;1086640;"This die is the key to winning in this city."

352;1095240;1098160;"Oh, no! A slot machine exploded!"

354;1100220;1102910;"That guy hit the jackpot five times in a row."
355;1103170;1105400;"And he was acting weird..."
356;1105400;1107310;"He kept rolling a funny-looking die."
357;1107910;1111290;"Yikes, his face is mush..."

and above as quickly as possible."

361;1121890;1124060;"As for cards rank A and below..."

366;1134190;1139220;"I-I know someone who got 
Bad Luck on the first roll and died!"
367;1139220;1141930;"If I roll Bad Luck,"
368;1141930;1145860;"I'll be hit for every Good Luck 
that the other players rolled!"
369;1145860;1147120;"Not my problem."
370;1147530;1148330;"Roll."

389;1208990;1210930;"Should we make the first move?"
390;1211350;1214520;"I already told you that combat 
should be our last resort."
391;1214520;1215440;"It's too early for that."
392;1215900;1218940;"No, we're trying to stay 
one step ahead of them."
