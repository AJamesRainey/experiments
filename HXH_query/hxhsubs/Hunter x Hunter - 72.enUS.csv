you can die, for all I care."

120;406670;407670;"Elevation!"
121;407670;410550;"You must maintain this stance, 
while staying perfectly still,"
122;410550;411970;"and only by releasing aura."
123;422490;426570;"If you can elevate around 
at least that high, you pass."
124;427220;428570;"Okay!"
125;449340;452070;"That training is a lot harder,"
126;452070;453840;"given that it's only a level higher."
127;454270;457900;"Naturally... Because this is 
really level-five training."

129;458750;461130;"Are you sure you should skip levels like that?"
130;461130;462810;"Well, it's a gamble."

132;466420;469970;"If we followed the proper sequence, 
he could reach level three easily."
133;469970;473110;"But that wouldn't do him any 
good in actual combat."
134;473660;477620;"He needs an Emitter attack that 
can push an opponent back"
135;477620;479120;"several meters with a direct hit."
136;479600;483590;"It must be that strong for 
him to use it as a weapon."
137;483590;485460;"So you jumped to level five..."
138;485460;488420;"But even if he clears the training,"
139;488420;491480;"the ability to send enemies flying 
isn't a desicively lethal weapon."
140;491960;493230;"Exactly right."
141;493230;497510;"It's only meant to give him more options."

171;591040;595150;"If they were using Accompany or Magnetic 
Force to move straight to us, we'd know,"
172;595150;596390;"but that isn't the case."
173;596900;600390;"They're using hit and run tactics, 
then making clean escapes."

but before long, they find us."

270;955690;956970;"Accompany on!"
271;956970;957810;"To Soufrabi!"
272;958670;959990;"Accompany on!"
273;959990;960640;"Tsezgerra!"
274;965110;966240;"Accompany on!"
275;966240;967020;"To Masadora!"
276;967310;968370;"Accompany on!"
277;968370;968900;"Tsezgerra!"
278;980180;981300;"I'm out now."
279;981300;982140;"Barry!"
280;982140;982870;"Roger that."
281;983390;984750;"Accompany on!"
282;984750;985910;"To Soufrabi!"
283;989770;992850;"Damn, we only have five days left..."
284;993370;996390;"Don't you have any advice that 
could help him break through?"
285;996750;999690;"The sensation of aura flowing through the body"
286;999690;1001890;"is different for everyone."
287;1002460;1006110;"If I give him advice from my own perception 
and he makes incorrect assumptions,"
288;1006110;1008850;"it could end up hurting more than helping."
289;1015670;1017080;"How many do we have left?"
290;1017080;1018860;"Seven copies of Accompany."
291;1019380;1020570;"They aren't coming..."
292;1020570;1021560;"Did they give up?"
293;1022220;1023310;"No way."
294;1023650;1026060;"They're taking their time to throw us off."
295;1026060;1028530;"If we run out of Accompany, 
we'll have to use Return."
296;1028530;1029600;"Understood."
297;1029600;1031930;"We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi."
298;1031930;1032920;"How's it going over there?"
299;1033430;1034320;"Let's find out."
300;1035240;1036640;"Contact on."
301;1036640;1037180;"Goreinu."
302;1038520;1039290;"This is Tsezgerra."
303;1039720;1040960;"How's it going there?"
304;1041300;1043180;"You were right."
305;1043520;1045530;"Sub and Bara have appeared."
306;1045530;1047190;"Most likely the real ones."
307;1047950;1052440;"They're speculating that I'll try to buy 
cards while they're playing tag."
308;1053040;1057420;"Which means it's Genthru and a couple 
of fakes that are chasing you."
309;1057420;1059780;"Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!"
310;1060130;1061830;"The same trick won't work again."
311;1062280;1066580;"Right now, Genthru is alone, 
while there are four of us."
312;1066580;1067460;"This is our chance!"
313;1067990;1071710;"No, I would prefer better odds for a fight."
314;1072130;1073860;"We'll stick to the original plan."
315;1077260;1078290;"Here they come."
316;1078290;1079760;"We're back on the run!"
317;1084280;1084930;"Gon..."
318;1085740;1086690;"Time's up."
319;1087170;1088480;"Your training's over."
320;1088850;1090480;"We still have five days!"
321;1090480;1092060;"Change in plans."
322;1092060;1094400;"I came up with a plan for defeating them."
323;1094400;1096110;"But... But..."
324;1096390;1098280;"Uh, well..."
325;1098280;1100210;"I think I've almost got it."
326;1100530;1101200;"Maybe..."
327;1101200;1102420;"No, it isn't happening."
328;1102420;1106120;"And I can't use an unreliable 
technique in my plan..."
329;1106640;1107430;"Give up."
330;1108350;1110590;"So the plan is..."
331;1110590;1111880;"To use this."
332;1112430;1113150;"Huh?"
333;1113970;1115800;"You'll have to learn this the hard way."
334;1115800;1118030;"Until you get it down to perfection."
335;1121720;1123680;"We're out of Accompany cards..."
336;1123680;1124930;"Use Return!"
337;1128070;1129450;"Return on!"
338;1129450;1130460;"To Aiai!"
339;1133110;1135400;"They're out of Accompany cards?"
340;1135400;1137270;"We're finally getting close."
341;1138310;1139350;"Sub, Bara..."
342;1139770;1141230;"How's it going? Catch anyone?"
343;1141690;1145620;"Only one, and it was someone new to the game."
344;1146420;1148870;"Word's out that the bombers are hunting"
345;1148870;1151130;"players around here, so everyone's staying away."
346;1152080;1156130;"Could he have been someone 
we already disposed of?"
347;1157100;1158400;"Perhaps..."
348;1158400;1160240;"Okay, come back."
349;1160620;1162030;"I'm in Soufrabi now."
350;1164440;1166990;"They're out of bullets."
351;1171020;1173770;"Leave 

Send one target player 
off the island. 

[SR][NORM]"
352;1171700;1173770;"We're finally down to our last card."
353;1174210;1178450;"If they follow us outside the game, 
we can fend them off at the mansion."
354;1178450;1181530;"If they don't follow us, we just have 
to wait until the time limit is up."
355;1181950;1183530;"It's perfect..."
356;1183530;1186150;"All that's left is choosing the 
three to keep for winning."
357;1186150;1189540;"We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants."
358;1192120;1193540;"Okay, let's go!"
359;1194200;1195200;"Leave!"
360;1211680;1213030;"No one's here."
361;1213030;1214190;"What's going on?"
362;1214520;1216690;"Weren't armed guards standing by?"
363;1217230;1219020;"Sabazushi, where are you?"
364;1219020;1220440;"Answer if you're there!"
365;1220870;1221980;"Sabazushi!"
366;1222570;1224450;"Keep it down..."
367;1224760;1227450;"I was taking a nap."
368;1227450;1228870;"A nap?"
369;1229330;1230980;"What happened to everyone else?"
370;1230980;1232260;"They left."
371;1232970;1235540;"Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing."
372;1235540;1238240;"We received an intermediary fee 
and a cancellation fee."
373;1238240;1241650;"But I stayed behind because I 
thought I should inform you."
374;1242760;1244060;"Canceled?"
375;1246000;1247010;"Mr. Battera!"
376;1247370;1249350;"What is the meaning of this?!"
377;1249350;1251180;"We're so close!"
378;1251180;1253020;"We're close to beating the game!"
379;1253910;1255210;"It doesn't matter..."
380;1255580;1256950;"Doesn't matter anymore."
381;1257660;1258840;"Doesn't matter?!"
382;1258840;1259680;"That's crap!"
383;1260040;1263030;"What about all the time and effort we've spent?"
384;1263560;1266370;"My lawyers have been instructed to pay you."
385;1267070;1270620;"You can do whatever you want with the cards."
386;1271850;1273430;"So now,"
387;1274470;1277250;"just leave me alone..."
388;1279960;1281190;"Damn!"
389;1282280;1283860;"What's going on?"
390;1283860;1285050;"I don't know."
391;1285050;1287490;"Why did this happen?"
392;1292360;1295380;"We're free to kill them out here."
393;1295380;1297850;"Since their ring data won't disappear."
394;1302100;1306790;"Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his 
friends the time that they promised."
395;1306790;1311160;"But awaiting them was a 
situation they didn't expect."
396;1381150;1388070;"G.I. Tutorial"
397;1381850;1384840;"Coming up, it's the 
Greed Island Tutorial!"
398;1387130;1389080;"Today, we introduce the card Fake."
399;1388070;1399530;"Fake 

Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099. 
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket. 
But it will not count toward Book completion, 
and cannot be transformed into an item. 
It also will not count toward card limit. 

[SR][NORM]"
400;1389080;1392260;"It can transform into any card from 001 to 099."
401;1393450;1395230;"But it doesn't count toward binder completion."
402;1395950;1397160;"And it can't be transformed into an item."
403;1398570;1399540;"Funny face!"
404;1399880;1401250;"Continue? {D: TC - sounds like a question to me, but see what you think}"
405;1405530;1407720;"Next time: Insanity x And x Sanity."
406;1407720;1408550;"Hey, Gon,"
407;1408550;1409980;"want to see my special attack?"
408;1409980;1410990;"I sure do!"
409;1410990;1412850;"You'll have to wait till next week!"
410;1412850;1414420;"Are you insane?"
