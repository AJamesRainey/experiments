3;98990;103990;"Defeat x And x Dignity"
4;106590;108250;"Why?"
5;108940;113730;"Had you remained silent, 
I could have killed him."
6;115040;117810;"Why are you so needlessly frightened?"
7;118260;120060;"He noticed you."
8;120600;122800;"If you'd approached him with the intent to kill,"
9;123260;126380;"he would have immediately attacked Komugi."
10;127990;130900;"That was a risk I didn't want to take."
11;132860;134340;"Your words baffle me."
12;135240;138900;"Isn't he sitting there because 
he wants to help that girl?"
13;139350;143490;"You almost make it sound like 
he means to harm her."
14;143490;144530;"Why?"
15;145090;147020;"It's none of your business."
16;148150;149420;"Shut up."
17;156460;159430;"Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon."
18;160320;162430;"You go find Knuckle."
19;163140;164990;"Pouf is outside the barrier,"
20;165440;167470;"so it's very likely the big guy was taken out."
21;168000;169180;"Review the situation,"
22;169180;171450;"then you and Knuckle decide what 
to do, and whether to retreat."
23;171450;173470;"Wh-What about you guys?"
24;173880;176850;"Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge."
25;178260;180200;"At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's."
26;181600;182700;"I'm kidding!"
27;183300;184770;"It'll be fine."
28;184770;187830;"I've always got the magic word, "Kite"!"
29;188270;189630;"I have it under control."
30;190000;191460;"Really?"
31;192240;195620;"Then why did you"
32;197500;200660;"look so sad back there?"
33;205250;206910;"You're sure, then?"
34;207960;211320;"You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway."
35;211860;214400;"Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!"
36;218310;220400;"It's none of your business."
37;221360;222350;"Shut up."
38;226910;228160;"Shut up?"
39;245540;247930;"Downwind, huh?"
40;251020;252360;"Am I interrupting something?"
41;253100;256730;"Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then."
42;257260;258400;"Don't move."
43;259460;260620;"Stay right there."
44;261500;264160;"You can use your wing scales to control others, right?"
45;264660;266700;"Don't take a single step."
46;270650;272430;"Pouf, please!"
47;273240;274590;"Are you insane?"
48;275430;278280;"You want me to stand here and do nothing?"
49;279250;281000;"For that woman's sake?"
50;281990;283280;"For the King's sake!"
51;285600;287220;"Do as he says..."
52;291390;293100;"What happened?"
53;295190;298750;"Your expression has changed..."
54;300710;305180;"What happened while I was trapped?"
55;312630;317260;"I promise that I shall not move from this spot."
56;317680;319630;"In return, I want you to tell me"
57;320510;323630;"everything that has happened thus far."
58;327320;332640;"If I ask where the King is, he'll 
get suspicious and silence us."
59;333470;336240;"Drop me hints while you explain what's happened."
60;338080;341330;"Be careful to make it sound quite natural."
61;342000;345400;"If you fail, we will see bloodshed."
62;346420;348090;"That's all there is to it."
63;357680;358780;"It's time."
64;358780;360120;"Adding interest."
65;366430;367580;"I've got it..."
66;369070;371820;"I could feel myself controlling the explosion."
67;375140;379810;"If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered."
68;380750;382000;"I need rage..."
69;382000;385070;"I must build up my rage before 
I forget how it felt!"
70;387160;390710;"That's the second time you've 
made a fool out of me!"
71;390710;393330;"Scum! Trash!"
72;393560;395720;"Piece of crap!"
73;403210;406010;"Stay calm, and let rage consume me..."
74;406890;409340;"Create and destroy at the same time."
75;410460;413350;"Manifested through this body!"
76;413990;416680;"Youpi had yet to notice"
77;417200;420850;"why two conflicting emotions 
could exist simultaneously..."
78;421710;424530;"Or what his current predicament was."
79;427510;428930;"Rage..."
80;429540;433120;"Rage is not intended to be scattered."
81;433120;435370;"It's meant to be focused on a target!"
82;440310;445250;"{\fad(292,1)}I Will Destroy You!!!"
83;441450;444610;"I will destroy you!"
84;454730;456270;"Okay! Okay!"
85;456270;458310;"It's a fake, okay!"
86;458310;460380;"Keep it up..."
87;460380;462680;"Make me madder!"
88;462680;464310;"Come on!"
89;474930;476030;"It's time."
90;476030;477360;"Adding interest."
91;480070;482080;"APR's interest is calculated"
92;482080;485710;"assuming that aura consumption will 
continue to rise at the current rate."
93;485710;490560;"Even if Youpi were to reduce his 
aura usage to a bare minimum,"
94;491300;494140;"in another three minutes and fifty seconds,"
95;494820;499180;"he would reach the point at which 
he would be unable to use <i>Nen</i>."
96;503290;505190;"Ten left."
97;511070;513360;"My back's against the wall..."
98;514220;518050;"Looks like he's saving me for last."
99;520040;524580;"In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!"
100;527390;532130;"Morel had deployed all of his puppets 
close enough for Youpi to see"
101;532130;536710;"so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements,"
102;536710;544770;"but also because he no longer had the 
strength to move his puppets around."
103;546050;550270;"If he lost his focus, the puppets would 
return to smoke and dissipate."
104;551220;553070;"It shouldn't be much longer..."
105;554530;556660;"<i>He has to run out of</i> Nen <i>at some point.</i>"
106;557370;558310;"But..."
107;559670;561830;"But damn..."
108;562200;564940;"My body and soul..."
109;564940;566250;"refuse to move."
110;567570;572690;"At this point, Morel could not 
even will himself to stand."
111;573310;578250;"He had literally reached his limit 
even before Youpi went bankrupt."
112;584760;587060;"Zero left..."
113;593050;596450;"I have something to say to you."
114;597500;599370;"Now that Youpi had learned"
115;599370;604290;"how to store his rage elsewhere, 
his head was much clearer."
116;609090;611830;"You look like a little fly that's about to die."
117;613300;614800;"And yet..."
118;615160;617050;"That's what makes you guys amazing."
119;619280;623400;"During the battle, Youpi had 
evolved at an alarming rate,"
120;623400;628300;"increasing the gap between 
the Hunters and himself."
121;628300;632530;"Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated."
122;633920;637580;"Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi,"
123;637580;641500;"this must have been the last thing he 
expected Youpi to say in this situation."
124;641830;649140;"But Morel could honestly accept 
that this was Youpi's true nature."
125;650720;652500;"I'm not sure how to say this..."
126;653090;655580;"But because you've impressed me,"
127;656280;658030;"I have to be sure to kill you."
128;658430;660220;"It's only proper, I guess?"
129;662850;664570;"This is game over."
130;666530;669660;"Well, I'll end this with one blow."
131;669660;670730;"Don't move."
132;671630;675230;"I don't think I even mind letting him"
133;675800;677990;"kill me now."
134;678760;679990;"Bye."
135;700760;701870;"He disappeared?"
136;705460;706260;"There's blood..."
137;707040;708270;"What's going on?"
138;708890;711020;"It wasn't teleportation?"
139;712270;715150;"The moment I was about to cut through him,"
140;716280;717650;"he disappeared."
141;718930;723760;"I thought that one of them had the 
ability to use teleportation..."
142;724300;726890;"But when he disappeared, 
I didn't see anyone else."
143;728000;733920;"And I struck before he disappeared, so if 
he teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood."
144;734780;736550;"But I was able to cut him."
145;736550;738220;"Yet I can no longer see him."
146;738680;740550;"Does that mean he only turned invisible?"
147;741070;742420;"An ability to become transparent?"
148;743620;747680;"{\fad(1,433)}If he had that ability, 
he would have used it sooner."
149;748470;750920;"Which means one of the others"
150;750920;754940;"must be able to make himself 
and the rest invisible."
151;755460;760400;"And right before I connected, he tried 
to save the guy with the sunglasses."
152;762760;765450;"But I left a deep wound."
153;778790;779650;"Here he comes!"
154;780780;781760;"The blood..."
155;782440;784350;"Youpi can follow the blood!"
156;784740;788220;"We may be invisible, but the 
blood is leaving a trail."
157;788790;793690;"If he swings that blade again, 
I'll have to get away by myself."
158;796060;798140;"I'm running out of breath..."
159;799870;801480;"Damn it!"
160;810840;812270;"Knuckle?!"
161;814010;816120;"Why did you reveal yourself?"
162;816670;822290;"Right now, your job is to stay 
hidden as long as possible!"
163;826590;829340;"I'm done running and hiding."
164;829340;830640;"I'll face you."
165;832690;833640;"So..."
166;836300;838150;"Let them escape."
167;841710;845650;"Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists"
168;846240;850290;"because Youpi's words had 
struck a chord with him."
169;854710;856160;"You're crazy."
170;856720;859140;"You can't even call that a trade-off."
171;861650;862980;"My answer"
172;865620;866420;"is no."
173;869260;870180;"However..."
174;873160;876680;"If you get rid of this thing, 
my answer might change."
175;878950;882440;"I'm sure this has to do with why you've 
been constantly on the run."
176;883760;886440;"Removing it will make the 
exchange more even."
177;891090;893450;"No... Don't do it!"
178;894010;897450;"Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!"
179;898330;903460;"Morel's desperate cry did not reach 
Knuckle due to God's Accomplice."
180;904120;907970;"However, it did return Meleoron to his senses."
181;918680;921100;"Leave me here..."
182;923050;924110;"You can't!"
183;924300;926860;"You can't do that, Knuckle!"
184;927330;930110;"Don't worry about me..."
185;931200;933370;"Will you waste everything we've done?"
186;934230;938450;"Everything that Morel, and Shoot..."
187;938920;939870;"and you..."
188;940120;942120;"have done by risking your lives!"
189;945670;949780;"If Knuckle didn't act, the two of 
them could still fight together."
190;950130;954010;"To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden."
191;954650;958460;"With that in mind, the decision that 
Meleoron made after leaving Morel..."
192;959190;960270;"Knuckle!"
193;960790;962020;"Knuckle!"
194;969330;971030;"...ended up backfiring."
195;972520;973660;"Impossible..."
196;975200;978190;"We no longer have a way..."
197;978880;981290;"to defeat Youpi..."
198;981840;984290;"Why..."
199;984990;992330;"The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded 
Knuckle of Shoot, and broken him."
200;995470;998870;"Okay... I took away APR!"
201;999260;1000760;"Now the terms are even."
202;1001420;1003060;"Leave the boss alone!"
203;1006530;1009090;"Fight me!"
204;1009090;1011320;"Kill me!"
205;1017450;1018700;"No way."
206;1021420;1022510;"Hold on!"
207;1022510;1023710;"Where are you going?!"
208;1025340;1027750;"To the King, obviously."
209;1028880;1031000;"Do you want to come with me?"
210;1031000;1032460;"I doubt you could handle it."
211;1034040;1037470;"His ability isn't teleportation, is it?"
212;1039230;1043120;"Then you'll have to carry the 
guy in sunglasses to a doctor,"
213;1043120;1045730;"or you struck this deal for nothing."
214;1049480;1052520;"If protecting the King was his first priority,"
215;1052520;1055200;"he should have killed all three on the spot."
216;1058900;1060280;"It's no big deal..."
217;1060790;1065250;"You weaklings can attack me all you 
want, but I'll still shake you off."
218;1066200;1070170;"The fact that he was aware of this, 
but didn't carry it out,"
219;1070170;1074330;"irritated Youpi on a level that didn't 
compare to his previous rage."
220;1076060;1077810;"Come for me whenever you want."
221;1077810;1080260;"I'll fight you as equals."
222;1081730;1083560;"I don't need to kill you right now..."
223;1084410;1086210;"And that's all there is to it!"
224;1088280;1091150;"Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit."
225;1092450;1096820;"During this battle, Youpi had learned 
how profound <i>Nen</i> really was."
226;1097230;1101190;"That also altered what little 
sense of self he'd had before."
227;1101540;1106990;"Having learned to quarantine 
his rage and stay calm,"
228;1106990;1110670;"Youpi had lost his ability to 
see things in simple terms."
229;1116460;1119380;"They're responsible for the rage I've built up,"
230;1119380;1123380;"so why don't I feel like using it on them?"
231;1125670;1131510;"What, or who, am I supposed 
to unleash this rage upon?"
232;1133570;1135420;"Was this a sign of maturation?"
233;1136340;1138290;"Youpi wasn't sure."
234;1139960;1142450;"However, as for Knuckle..."
235;1148210;1152150;"I completely lost..."
236;1153560;1154590;"Knuckle!"
237;1156800;1158340;"We gotta help the big guy!"
238;1162560;1163910;"Come on, boss."
239;1166360;1170600;"I told you to leave me here..."
240;1171700;1172860;"Go!"
241;1174230;1176680;"The two of you..."
242;1177100;1178450;"can still fight."
243;1180080;1182360;"Do what you can."
244;1183590;1186730;"He said to go whenever you want."
245;1187290;1189630;"So go now!"
246;1192010;1193150;"I can't."
247;1195010;1199960;"I can no longer think of him..."
248;1199960;1203390;"as a target to destroy."
249;1205130;1206390;"Wait..."
250;1207440;1210420;"He acknowledged our efforts."
251;1211510;1213360;"He wasn't a bad guy."
252;1215520;1218900;"In that case, I no longer have..."
253;1219440;1221430;"any reason to defeat him."
254;1222180;1223410;"The King..."
255;1225520;1226660;"Knov-san!"
256;1229130;1231410;"The soldiers are not important."
257;1231980;1236210;"If the King waves his baton, the soldiers 
will become demons if necessary."
258;1238010;1239740;"I'll take care of Morel..."
259;1239740;1241430;"Shoot is also okay."
260;1244550;1246530;"Are you guys also coming?"
261;1246530;1249900;"Wait, let me sock this baby hard."
262;1249900;1252690;"I received a message from 
the chairman's messenger."
263;1254650;1257940;"As planned, he was able to take the 
King to the appointed location."
264;1259330;1263690;"If they leave now, the Royal 
Guard won't make it in time."
265;1263690;1267130;"Their job is done, and so is ours."
266;1269620;1270720;"Where's Palm?"
267;1270720;1272080;"We don't know yet."
268;1272080;1273260;"Okay..."
269;1275210;1276460;"What will you do?"
270;1276780;1279930;"I don't know if I'll be back again."
