1;3610;6560;"That's Morel's Smoky Jail..."
2;7960;11520;"The ability he's using to separate 
Pouf from the King."
3;12980;15990;"If the third floor of the tower 
is surrounded by smoke,"
4;16740;18880;"the King and Pitou aren't there."
5;19340;20220;"Where are they?"
6;133980;139030;"Divide x And x Conquer"
7;144980;146810;"Each has begun his own battle"
8;147330;150300;"in his own respective location."
9;208070;208970;"Gon..."
10;229840;230780;"Grandpa!"
11;232630;234540;"Which means that that's..."
12;240910;241810;"the King!"
13;244180;245300;"Proceed."
14;246710;251170;"I am fully aware that you seek 
to accomplish your objective"
15;251170;255310;"with minimal human casualties."
16;256660;259850;"You took advantage of the chaos in the palace"
17;259850;262320;"in order to separate my Royal Guard from me."
18;265080;266180;"It makes no difference."
19;268420;269330;"Proceed."
20;287110;288940;"Dragon Head!"
21;290520;292530;"He is frightening..."
22;293020;297100;"The technique he unleashed was 
not intended to hurt the King."
23;297910;301530;"And both of them could tell that the King"
24;301530;303250;"realized this at once."
25;305020;309480;"Zeno made certain that his <i>Nen</i> 
was completely neutral."
26;309960;312960;"Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it..."
27;350780;351780;"Killua..."
28;353340;355140;"Pitou is over there."
29;359370;360170;"Let's go!"
30;369670;370700;"Let's go..."
31;375890;377640;"In what sense did you mean that?"
32;381710;386530;"Killua barely managed to stop himself 
from asking the question."
33;388740;390100;"If I ask that question,"
34;391480;393160;"I won't be able to stop anymore..."
35;394710;396010;"I won't be able to go back."
36;400640;405050;"If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer."
37;406450;410980;"Anyone with enough experience 
would easily arrive at that next step."
38;411720;415060;"But the fear of losing someone he cared for"
39;415620;420290;"prevented him from taking that step."
40;428970;431270;"A few moments before the dragon took flight,"
41;432000;434830;"Cheetu and Brovada appeared"
42;435140;437540;"before Ikalgo."
43;438030;439590;"Hey, it's Flutter."
44;458060;459520;"What's with all the noise?"
45;459900;462850;"Pitou-dono's <i>En</i> disappeared again."
46;463290;466040;"I just returned..."
47;466040;468350;"It seems the enemy is attacking."
48;468800;469720;"Seriously?"
49;470300;473510;"Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this."
50;476290;478040;"What happened to your wings?"
51;478040;479600;"Oh, uh..."
52;479600;482080;"I lost them earlier, during the attack."
53;483140;484090;"Are you going underground?"
54;484610;488340;"Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama."
55;489340;490790;"What should we do?"
56;492540;496560;"Well, we weren't told to defend this place..."
57;496880;499590;"But I'm just itching to try"
58;500500;501770;"my new technique."
59;505570;506220;"It's huge..."
60;521750;523120;"That looks fun!"
61;523560;524900;"I'm gonna check it out!"
62;525790;526630;"Be careful!"
63;527510;529780;"I'm gonna see what's going on!"
64;530230;532310;"Then, I'll be going."
65;532310;533130;"Okay."
66;546900;549150;""Hagya-sama"?"
67;562080;565910;"Meanwhile, in the throne room, 
in the central tower..."
68;577680;580040;"Is it truly possible"
69;580650;583680;"to trap me in one place?"
70;585610;587810;"Why don't we find out?"
71;591490;592820;"Wing scales..."
72;593990;597820;"Knov said that they can hypnotize people."
73;598840;601500;"I don't want to inhale any..."
74;603430;605450;"You seem to be finished talking."
75;606370;608980;"I would expect that of anyone 
with considerable power."
76;609560;610330;"However..."
77;620180;622520;"Caution, resolve,"
78;623550;628100;"and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio."
79;630220;634250;"His caution isn't as strong 
because he's confident."
80;634750;636860;"It's safe to say he has a strong personality."
81;638240;641310;"Pouf's Spiritual Message"
82;641310;647250;"surrounds his opponent with wing scales, 
making their aura more opaque,"
83;647880;651260;"letting him sense their state of mind."
84;654750;657010;"I suppose I should introduce myself."
85;659660;663960;"I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard."
86;670540;674400;"His caution has increased slightly."
87;677630;680280;"You won't tell me your name?"
88;681210;683430;"If you believe that I'm trying"
89;683430;691910;"to trick you into inhaling my wing 
scales, you're sadly mistaken."
90;691910;694910;"And to be honest, I'm a little shocked."
91;700530;702940;"After a rebirth, all will be forgotten."
92;720150;721930;"I'll need you to wait a moment."
93;732810;736150;"If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me."
94;737710;741510;"No matter what sort of beast he emerges as..."
95;774250;777860;"Shoot was fighting recklessly, 
without concern for his life,"
96;778230;781460;"which turned out to be the 
reason he was still alive."
97;784340;786090;"Hotel Rafflesia..."
98;787950;792150;"While barely dodging multiple attacks that 
would have been otherwise lethal,"
99;792150;797390;"Shoot had only managed to take 
the eye on Youpi's shoulder."
100;798230;801280;"He had essentially done no damage."
101;802200;803240;"However..."
102;810270;812750;"Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent."
103;813360;818830;"The strange sensation that his momentum 
was being stolen, rather than stopped,"
104;818830;822250;"influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously."
105;823320;827000;"After taking multiple hits from 
attacks he didn't understand,"
106;827000;828760;"Youpi was backing up."
107;829900;833770;"I can't let this guy near the King."
108;836370;841150;"Every second I keep him away 
from the King counts."
109;843000;846280;"Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective."
110;847050;850260;"However, this expected turn of events"
111;850700;854040;"was difficult on Knuckle..."
112;857360;858700;"Hold it in..."
113;858700;860290;"I can't attack now!"
114;862370;866230;"If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting"
115;866230;871550;"that there's one more enemy 
he needs to worry about!"
116;875900;877060;"Hold it in!"
117;880320;883140;"Shoot was now covered in blood,"
118;883140;885570;"as he endured Youpi's ferocious 
barrage of attacks."
119;886620;890230;"Forced to watch from the sidelines,"
120;890820;893100;"just remaining hidden was a battle."
121;893720;896580;"No matter how he told himself to keep still..."
122;903840;906800;"Hold it in... Please hold it in!"
123;908500;912810;"Knuckle was unable to hold back the 
tears streaming down his face."
124;914840;916100;"You can do it!"
125;920110;921300;"It's time."
126;921300;922810;"Adding interest."
127;928960;931110;"Only ten seconds have passed?"
128;931510;932740;"You're kidding!"
129;934910;940790;"How much longer do I have to endure 
this suffocating, excruciating wait"
130;940790;943720;"that makes me want to do nothing but run away?"
131;945600;947000;"This must be some kind of joke..."
132;947400;949180;"And it isn't funny!"
133;957750;959770;"I can't hold it in any longer!"
134;965960;968320;"Knuckle's rampage was halted"
135;972880;975660;"by the first tap from Meleoron."
136;976970;980080;"Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!"
137;981610;984420;"But that just might have saved me."
138;986380;990490;"Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle."
139;991480;993870;"He, too, had reached his limit."
140;999360;1000360;"Crap!"
141;1003170;1004370;"Uh-oh."
142;1004770;1008880;"He barely scratched me, but it 
was enough damage"
143;1008880;1013580;"to offset the interest and 
my full-strength attack."
144;1014830;1018130;"Shoot is risking his life out there,"
145;1019160;1022840;"while I'm standing here unhurt, 
and making stupid mistakes!"
146;1024500;1027560;"Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything,"
147;1027560;1032460;"nor did he notice APR's declaration 
of returned interest."
148;1032800;1035470;"Damn!"
149;1036320;1038550;"He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either."
150;1039980;1041820;"Calm down, you fool..."
151;1041820;1043980;"You're gonna ruin everything."
152;1047000;1049480;"Here's the distance where we want to stay..."
153;1049480;1053720;"Not close enough for him to find us, 
but close enough to get in fast."
154;1054210;1057990;"He'll notice APR for a second, 
but that's no problem."
155;1060150;1061990;"Shoot's fighting hard,"
156;1063210;1066250;"so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron."
157;1069460;1071160;"God's Accomplice..."
158;1071160;1072170;"Undo."
159;1080170;1081790;"What is this thing?"
160;1082170;1083390;"When did it show up?"
161;1083390;1086220;"No, it can't be that I didn't notice it."
162;1086570;1088900;"It just suddenly appeared."
163;1089650;1091300;"Was I hit by an attack?"
164;1091840;1093880;"No, I wasn't."
165;1093880;1095450;"A delayed effect?"
166;1095990;1097530;"So it must have been then!"
167;1103910;1108330;"Does that mean the condition 
was met during the fight?"
168;1109790;1111880;"What is this number?"
169;1111880;1114250;"Is it a countdown? A bomb?"
170;1114760;1118150;"No, the number isn't going up or down."
171;1119780;1121260;"This is too much of a pain!"
172;1127590;1130270;"I only need to destroy the source!"
173;1131220;1132510;"Something's coming."
174;1133700;1136280;"Despite his overwhelming power,"
175;1136630;1139200;"one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot"
176;1139600;1143600;"was the evident difference in 
skill level between them."
177;1148710;1151220;"It's fast... I can't get away!"
178;1151800;1155050;"One skewered chunk of meat coming up!"
179;1164350;1167090;"He hit himself to accelerate."
180;1167900;1169140;"Very well..."
181;1171440;1172790;"That was close."
182;1173740;1177360;"The reaction to the attack told Youpi 
that he could win at any moment."
183;1177810;1181460;"Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy,"
184;1181460;1182940;"so this spurred him on."
185;1183960;1186600;"Youpi's analysis was on the mark."
186;1187160;1192030;"It was true that Youpi was 
increasingly likely to win this fight."
187;1193220;1198180;"If he made any mistake, it was not realizing"
188;1198180;1201170;"that Shoot was fine with this fact."
189;1227780;1229390;"I can keep going..."
190;1234670;1235930;"I..."
191;1237900;1240560;"can still fly."
192;1243890;1245010;"I'm not done..."
193;1247170;1251310;"However, quietly and surely..."
194;1251310;1254010;"Shoot was reaching his limit."
195;1265110;1268690;"Hey, Youpi!"
196;1272890;1275330;"Over here, fool!"
197;1280510;1281690;"Knuckle!"
198;1288550;1293480;"I'm telling him that there's one 
more enemy to worry about?"
199;1294800;1295980;"That's fine."
200;1297010;1300230;"That will serve to distract Youpi,"
201;1300590;1303110;"and it will save Shoot."
202;1305840;1307770;"Bring it!"
203;1311120;1315570;"After calming down and regaining composure,"
204;1316090;1318380;"Knuckle decided to show himself."
205;1405170;1407150;"Next time: Duty x And x Question."
206;1407150;1409050;"Huh? Where are you, Gon?"
207;1409590;1410430;"Over here."
208;1410430;1412420;"Gon! Wait, you disappeared again!"
209;1412420;1414360;"Perfect Plan... Undo!"
210;1414360;1416180;"I'm always by your side."
