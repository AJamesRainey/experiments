1;8490;11310;"Facing the palace, each of the three exits"
2;11810;14990;"is progressively closer to the throne room."
3;20070;22740;"Okay, we're all agreed."
4;23430;28020;"We'll all use the closest exit, 
and bust in from beside the central stairway."
5;109000;114000;"Confusion x And x Expectation"
6;119330;122920;"This seemed like a good idea 
since Leol-sama praised me so much,"
7;122920;124670;"but dispelling <i>Nen</i> is hard."
8;131480;136420;"And the stronger the <i>Nen</i>, 
the bigger my stomach gets."
9;136950;138490;"This was a bad idea."
10;139480;143620;"To a girl, there's nothing 
worse than losing your figure."
11;143920;147060;"I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!"
12;147060;148120;"Right, Shidore?"
13;151330;155250;"Having a peon that understands 
speech is useful, but..."
14;156070;159510;"You really need to talk more."
15;163240;166360;"You have permission to shoot her on sight!"
16;166760;170020;"As a foreigner, she can't blend 
in with the other citizens!"
17;170450;172810;"Damn! Damn that woman!"
18;173550;175170;"What does she want?"
19;175440;176150;"Hey!"
20;183060;186370;"How many times have I told you 
not to use your cell phone here?"
21;186640;189660;"The radio waves irritate my ears, 
and it gives me a headache!"
22;190150;191920;"Plus, I can hear what you're saying."
23;192770;195930;"Next time I catch you, I'll snap your 
phone and your arm in half."
24;195930;200150;"W-Well... There are urgent matters 
that must be dealt with."
25;200150;202300;"I need to use my phone."
26;203550;206310;"It's so urgent that you find 
the woman who ran away?"
27;208840;210640;"I can find her for you."
28;210960;212310;"R-Really?"
29;212760;215620;"My nose happens to be very sharp..."
30;216240;219460;"If you have something she wore, I can track her."
31;220020;223070;"The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do,"
32;223070;224740;"and I respect you, as well!"
33;225130;229330;"So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here."
34;230110;231080;"O-Okay!"
35;231540;233770;"Hold on, and I'll bring you something."
36;237480;239540;"I will become the King behind the scenes."
37;239540;243270;"To accomplish that, I must be friendly 
with Bizeff, not with the King."
38;243550;247640;"Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued."
39;247640;248220;"Bah."
40;248910;251250;"When peons send transmissions, 
it gives me a headache."
41;253830;255090;"This smells like..."
42;255090;256800;"Taragette's blood."
43;257110;259360;"There are bloodstains and dirty shoes."
44;259550;260680;"An intruder!"
45;261090;264360;"If he took his shoes off here 
to avoid leaving footprints,"
46;264860;267610;"he must be somewhere deeper within."
47;268060;269870;"He didn't hide his shoes because"
48;269870;274120;"he had a pressing mission and 
couldn't afford to lose time..."
49;275040;277100;"That day last week, when it rained?"
50;277730;281560;"That was the day Taragette went missing."
51;281990;284980;"I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him."
52;285860;289740;"But that means he disposed of Taragette's body"
53;289740;291600;"while leaving his shoes behind."
54;292140;294000;"There's no blood trail nearby."
55;294420;297890;"If he wrapped the body in something to move it,"
56;297890;300650;"he must have come prepared."
57;300960;302650;"Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?"
58;302960;304180;"Why would they do that?!"
59;304630;305900;"Damn, I don't get this!"
60;306480;308570;"Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?"
61;309110;312410;"No, I'll catch the intruder, 
and get the answers from him."
62;318530;321680;"He did head inside the palace!"
63;322320;324640;"This guy comes before Bizeff's woman..."
64;325440;326890;"Follow me!"
65;336840;339300;"What is your name?"
66;339300;342440;"It's K-K-Komugi."
67;342960;345380;"Can you please tell me what your name is?"
68;349610;352950;"I didn't get to learn his name..."
69;358640;361340;"I can't wait to play him again!"
70;369480;371600;"Who am I?"
71;373640;377300;"A nameless king... in a borrowed castle."
72;378200;382110;"My subjects are mindless puppets."
73;383500;386610;"If this is the fate that the 
heavens have granted me..."
74;390540;394940;"I have no doubt that I shall 
be slowly bored to death!"
75;406400;407630;"Don't follow me."
76;407980;409090;"Yes, but—"
77;411120;412390;"Do not make me repeat myself."
78;418790;421830;"Now we've all been beaten by the King."
79;425380;428150;"The King says your <i>En</i> is irritating him."
80;429530;432770;"I figured he would be saying that soon."
81;432770;435660;"But I can't remove our security..."
82;436490;438380;"Then you go and tell him that!"
83;438380;440590;"I don't want another beating."
84;441930;443700;"How does this sound?"
85;444520;448040;"We can block all aura in a radius 
surrounding Your Majesty."
86;448700;453050;"This way, my presence will not bother you."
87;453530;455680;"Are you telling me to stay in one place?"
88;456600;458680;"Given that keeping"
89;458680;463650;"the aura-free zone around me 
while I move wouldn't be possible."
90;463650;467340;"I refuse to have my movement 
constantly monitored."
91;467680;471700;"No, that would not be our proposal."
92;472070;476700;"So if I do not wish to deal with your presence, 
I will only be able to move"
93;476700;479190;"within that confined area."
94;479660;484960;"I must order you to move that zone 
should I wish to go elsewhere?"
95;485870;487910;"There is nothing more I can say."
96;488420;491940;"Keep your <i>En</i> focused outside the palace."
97;492370;495930;"I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection."
98;497150;498180;"Are you dissatisfied?"
99;498530;502440;"Should that not suffice to guard 
against outside attacks?"
100;502990;507110;"Or are you saying that there 
are already enemies inside?"
101;507850;514940;"That would be admitting that your <i>En</i>
 is completely worthless, would it not?"
102;515370;516620;"You're absolutely correct."
103;517410;522490;"If my <i>En</i> is focused only outside, it cannot detect"
104;522490;525020;"any attack from underground."
105;525930;526800;"In addition,"
106;526800;533080;"my <i>En</i> is not capable of recognizing 
an enemy that is already inside."
107;533280;536010;"Do you mean Komugi?"
108;536370;541690;"No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace,"
109;542250;547150;"and they are free to enter and leave at will."
110;547840;551340;"A check is performed each time someone enters,"
111;551670;555160;"but if the soldier were being 
controlled by the enemy,"
112;555160;557640;"it would be difficult to know for sure."
113;558120;558790;"That means—"
114;558790;559690;"Enough."
115;560020;562530;"You may use <i>En</i> on the first floor of the palace!"
116;562950;566290;"That will permit you to guard 
against any underground attack!"
117;567090;570030;"Tell everyone that no one is allowed 
on the second floor or above."
118;570410;574800;"Should an intruder come, I shall 
deal with them personally."
119;575360;577980;"Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!"
120;577980;580540;"If you disturb me, it will 
have violent consequences!"
121;582310;583730;"The other Ants"
122;583730;587810;"were never allowed on or above the second floor..."
123;588680;591470;"But where do I go now?"
124;591470;595440;"The central stairway connecting the 
first and second floors, I suppose..."
125;596340;598800;"If an intruder comes from underground,"
126;598800;601200;"you will be in position to deal with them."
127;601580;604740;"Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately."
128;605200;608490;"Is he upset about losing 
all those Gungi matches?"
129;610240;614270;"I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation."
130;614970;620470;"My ability, Spiritual Message, would be 
able to confirm my suspicions."
131;621640;625710;"However, that would be an insult to the King!"
132;626390;628750;"No, I'm just making excuses..."
133;629620;633000;"The truth is that I'm afraid."
134;634370;636470;"So afraid of what it is"
135;637470;640500;"that grows inside the King even as we speak,"
136;641800;643090;"I cannot bear it..."
137;651170;655130;"Tsk, the rain washed away the scent."
138;655130;656640;"But now I have the answer."
139;657810;661010;"The intruder hid here to 
check the second floor,"
140;661520;664280;"but instead of going upstairs, he exited."
141;665120;667330;"Something made him give up his mission?"
142;667960;670770;"Or did he accomplish his objective?"
143;670770;673390;"No, he may have used his power!"
144;675400;677130;"I should probably warn you..."
145;677550;681030;"If any of you go to the second 
floor, the King will kill you."
146;681860;684280;"Tell everyone else in the palace."
147;685020;685780;"Yes, sir."
148;686220;687590;"Wings!"
149;687590;690560;"What if the intruder has the power to fly?"
150;691030;693090;"The shoes and scent could have 
been there to mislead us."
151;693760;697050;"He could have flown up to the second floor!"
152;697390;698380;"Youpi-dono..."
153;698720;699300;"Huh?"
154;699570;701200;"Uh, er..."
155;701670;703860;"<i>Pitou is monitoring the palace with </i>En."
156;704170;708350;"If they'd gone to the second floor, 
they would have been caught..."
157;708350;711210;"Ah, sorry... It's not important."
158;711470;712400;"Huh?"
159;712400;713650;"That doesn't make sense!"
160;713650;716960;"Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!"
161;716960;717860;"Youpi-dono..."
162;718290;719820;"Huh? What is it?"
163;720410;723370;"Has Pitou-dono ever ceased to use <i>En</i>?"
164;723700;727200;"For example, that day last week when it rained?"
165;727720;730290;"What? You didn't hear what happened?"
166;730290;731970;"There was a huge uproar..."
167;732380;734710;"The King tore off his own arm!"
168;736060;740980;"Pitou had to heal the King, 
so Pouf was using his <i>En</i> instead."
169;740980;743970;"How wide is his <i>En</i>?"
170;744360;746420;"I wouldn't know about that..."
171;746420;748100;"Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?"
172;748840;753550;"No, I'd guess that Pouf's </i>En<i> only 
reached as far as the stairway."
173;754150;755900;"The intruder saw that aura,"
174;755900;757810;"and gave up on ascending!"
175;757810;758730;"That all makes sense."
176;759290;761230;"The question is what the 
intruder's objective was,"
177;761230;765610;"and whether he's still hiding around here."
178;766600;768740;"Do I tell Youpi?"
179;768740;770620;"No, I can't do that..."
180;771900;774230;"I should report this to Pitou or Pouf."
181;774230;775770;"Pouf would be the best choice."
182;776200;779380;"And if possible, I need to determine"
183;779380;781250;"what the intruder's objective was."
184;782290;783880;"Otherwise, my report would be"
185;783880;787210;"that the intruder somehow 
made it inside the palace,"
186;787210;790640;"but turned and ran when he felt Pouf's</i> En<i>."
187;790640;792440;"I won't get any credit."
188;793460;796760;"I can make up an objective,"
189;796760;799430;"but if the intruder is captured, 
they'll find out I lied."
190;799800;804470;"But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions 
and the intruder is never found,"
191;804470;809100;"it would only waste their time 
and damage my own standing."
192;810660;812160;"Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!"
193;813700;815310;"I have a great idea..."
194;816480;819910;"So the intruder captured one of my men."
195;819910;824300;"According to Leol, that intruder 
has the ability to teleport."
196;824690;827250;"I believe that he and the 
woman are working together."
197;827250;829690;"They probably teleported out together."
198;830500;833870;"Damn, but why would they do that?"
199;833870;835810;"Yes, that's the question."
200;836320;839900;"However, I've discerned their objective."
201;839900;840440;"What is it?"
202;841680;843940;"To blow up the palace."
203;844590;845370;"That's a lie."
204;845370;846220;"What?"
205;846220;847850;"We must tell the Royal Guard!"
206;847850;848810;"Wait."
207;849640;851010;"Don't be in such a rush."
208;851010;853450;"We can tell them after we've found the bomb."
209;853870;855290;"There's no time!"
210;855780;858790;"Calm down, and consider this 
from their perspective..."
211;859090;859940;"Eh?"
212;859940;863470;"If they want to blow up the palace, 
they'll wait until they're sure the King is here."
213;863820;864800;"When would that be?"
214;865440;867460;"When all the citizens have assembled..."
215;867970;870350;"Right before the ceremony begins!"
216;871000;873260;"There will be five million humans!"
217;873260;874580;"What a sight that will be to see..."
218;874980;876690;"Just imagine looking down on them!"
219;877180;880200;"The King would not allow a double 
to steal that gratification from him!"
220;880690;883450;"So he will be there in person!"
221;883990;887090;"It's only logical to assume the enemy 
reached the same conclusion."
222;887090;888080;"True..."
223;888530;892540;"I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's 
side for many of these celebrations..."
224;893490;897960;"The experience brings indescribable 
pleasure beyond even sexual gratification."
225;898240;900720;"We still have over half a day 
before the ceremony."
226;901090;903670;"If I use my nose to track the intruder,"
227;904070;906740;"we can find the bomb with time to spare."
228;907310;911970;"If we have proof when we report to the 
Royal Guard, we'll look much better."
229;912390;916510;"If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful."
230;917160;917860;"Right?"
231;918770;921530;"Yes... That's true."
232;922800;925800;"As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you."
233;926070;927430;"Okay, that sounds good."
234;930560;933870;"The coward finally calmed down?"
235;936160;940620;"I'm getting closer to becoming 
the King behind the scenes!"
236;949020;950380;"Seven minutes to go."
237;950760;953350;"I'll give a call when it's down to one minute."
238;953350;954920;"Assemble near the exit then."
239;955340;957010;"Until then, stand by."
240;958790;961620;"Meleoron, about your power..."
241;961620;962970;"I know."
242;962970;966400;"I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds 
before I need to breathe..."
243;967160;971150;"And then, I'll tap you again when 
I start to hold my breath again!"
244;972780;975620;"You don't need to push your limits."
245;975620;978840;"You should catch your breath 
whenever you need to."
246;979260;984530;"When God's Accomplice isn't active, 
you can trust me to handle things."
247;990580;993260;"Why don't you have a smoke?"
248;993680;998290;"If you underestimate their sense 
of smell, you'll die quickly..."
249;998290;1002120;"Tracking someone by the smell of 
cigarette smoke is simple for them."
250;1002120;1006220;"We could be knocked out the 
second I take my first breath..."
251;1006590;1010730;"The boss will be putting up a smokescreen 
when we go in. It'll be fine."
252;1010730;1015320;"I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk."
253;1016480;1018580;"I don't want to regret my decision."
254;1020540;1022590;"The Royal Guard is on the move."
255;1024470;1028640;"The three of them gathered above the 
front gate to discuss something."
256;1029070;1031710;"Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside."
257;1032810;1035050;"Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales,"
258;1035050;1037720;"so I don't think anything has changed."
259;1039950;1041970;"I'll let you know if anything else happens."
260;1042620;1046600;"Yeah, until we leave, feed us as 
much information as you can."
261;1048740;1051630;"Essentially, that eliminates the 
possibility of the Royal Guard"
262;1051630;1052610;"being out of the palace."
263;1053220;1056580;"Essentially, but not completely..."
264;1056870;1060670;"Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King."
265;1060670;1061870;"You can't guarantee anything."
266;1062400;1065070;"We have to be prepared for any possibility,"
267;1065070;1067010;"or we'll be slow to react when 
something goes wrong!"
268;1067500;1070890;"You only say that because you don't 
understand how loyal they are."
269;1070890;1073320;"It's impossible that they'd leave the King!"
270;1073320;1076620;"The Royal Guard is always with the King!"
271;1076620;1079430;"And it's fine to believe that!"
272;1079430;1081590;"But we should prepare for any exceptions!"
273;1081590;1083390;"Give me an example of one 
of these exceptions!"
274;1083630;1086430;"{\an8}There are all kinds of exceptions!"
275;1084390;1088650;"Honestly, how can they be having 
a dispute at the last second?"
276;1086430;1088650;"{\an8}You're being too unrealistic!"
277;1089370;1091650;"One exception could be a woman..."
278;1093400;1095890;"Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?"
279;1096300;1100810;"I wasn't sure what the King was doing in 
the palace, but he was reproducing."
280;1100810;1102030;"That must be it."
281;1102700;1103800;"I see..."
282;1104170;1110080;"That would give the King a reason to keep 
the Royal Guard from his bedroom..."
283;1110520;1114550;"Perhaps Bizeff was bringing 
women in for the King."
284;1119320;1122260;"Palm and the King?!"
285;1124180;1125960;"We're sticking to the plan..."
286;1126370;1129180;"No matter what's happening to Palm!"
287;1130700;1132690;"Gon has no idea what they're talking about."
288;1133330;1136440;"I'm glad we realized this before we set out."
289;1136440;1138950;"If we'd seen something like 
that without warning,"
290;1138950;1140950;"we'd have frozen in our tracks."
291;1141360;1142680;"Get it now?"
292;1142680;1145530;"You can never overthink something."
293;1145900;1148830;"There are probably other unexpected 
situations that we haven't considered yet."
294;1149690;1152560;"Yes, something is still bothering me."
295;1153260;1153980;"Gon..."
296;1155040;1156210;"Do you understand?"
297;1156210;1158220;"Let Palm take care of herself!"
298;1158640;1161790;"No matter what you see, 
you must stay focused on Pitou."
299;1162220;1162970;"Yeah!"
300;1163790;1167440;"It bothers me, but whether 
a woman's involved or not,"
301;1167440;1170060;"I believe we should be prepared 
for a third party in the palace."
302;1170830;1172980;"I have a feeling that the third party"
303;1172980;1175160;"is causing my anxiety."
304;1175960;1178990;"Why did the King injure himself?"
305;1179350;1181110;"Hold on..."
306;1181110;1183990;"That was just a theory of yours."
307;1183990;1188000;"Yeah, but you agreed that there 
was no other logical explanation."
308;1188630;1191480;"You're contradicting yourself..."
309;1191480;1195130;"Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?"
310;1195480;1197550;"Following that logic,"
311;1197550;1203040;"Pitou could have stopped using <i>En</i> 
for other, unexpected reasons."
312;1203040;1204880;"I understand that..."
313;1204880;1206140;"But something doesn't feel right."
314;1206700;1212960;"With three minutes left to go, is this 
something worth thinking about?"
315;1213420;1214150;"Yeah."
316;1214500;1216780;"Yeah, think about it..."
317;1217160;1220730;"When would you try to hurt yourself?"
318;1225900;1229040;"When I couldn't forgive myself..."
319;1233480;1235680;"When you couldn't forgive yourself?"
320;1236550;1238050;"That's the logical conclusion..."
321;1238860;1244820;"But that would mean the King 
is a ruler with personal pride,"
322;1244820;1246400;"and not just a cold tyrant."
323;1246400;1247300;"True."
324;1248160;1253160;"For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain."
325;1253960;1255520;"Speaking from experience,"
326;1255520;1259180;"people like him will never 
be willing to compromise."
327;1259880;1263320;"If the leader refuses to compromise, 
neither will the Royal Guard."
328;1263970;1267010;"You should assume that combat 
will be our only option!"
329;1268640;1271050;"Morel was able to sum everything up..."
330;1271500;1272660;"But he's wrong."
331;1273630;1275120;"The King's self-injury..."
332;1275500;1277050;"The third party..."
333;1277750;1281210;"We still haven't correctly 
deduced what happened."
334;1282390;1283720;"I have a feeling..."
335;1284370;1290130;"that the truth has the potential 
to completely ruin our plans!"
336;1290590;1291660;"It's time!"
337;1292580;1294260;"One minute to go."
338;1294750;1295730;"Gather around."
339;1296380;1298480;"Damn! We're out of time..."
340;1310630;1313250;"At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown."
341;1315580;1316870;"Let's do this, boys."
342;1318240;1320270;"Get ready to rumble!"
343;1405030;1407350;"Next time: Charge x And x Invade."
344;1407350;1409900;"Yeah, hot pots are great in winter..."
345;1409900;1411700;"Which reminds me of mystery pots."
346;1411700;1412800;"Charge into the pot!"
347;1412800;1414020;"I think you mean toss into the pot..."
