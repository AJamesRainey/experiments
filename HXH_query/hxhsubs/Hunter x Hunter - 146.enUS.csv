10;133020;135560;"Yeah, I was with Kite..."
11;135560;137030;"Then Kite told me to run away,"
12;137030;138280;"and Pitou showed up."
13;138560;141470;"Kite lost his arm, I was knocked out,"

23;173410;174680;"Let's calm down."
24;174680;176820;"We should both try to calm down..."
25;177150;180560;"It was because I insisted..."

35;200450;201710;"That isn't true."
36;202830;207220;"He took you along because he believed in you."

underestimated the enemy."
38;214920;216950;"If he hadn't thought you capable,"
39;216950;220360;"he wouldn't have let you accompany 
him, no matter what you'd said."
40;221420;223990;"It was his fault that he misjudged the enemy."

43;226400;228470;"You're also at fault for being too weak!"

45;232750;234430;"Don't make the same mistake."
46;234880;238440;"And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!"
47;239490;243280;"You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,"
48;243280;244640;"but either way, you should apologize!"
49;246280;247150;"Yeah."
50;247550;249890;"When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule."
51;250290;251330;"Do you know it?"
52;251330;252200;"Huh?"
53;252200;254140;"No, what is it?"

57;264280;265820;"Okay, get going!"
58;265820;266620;"Yeah!"

60;273290;274370;"Can I..."
61;274790;277670;"talk to you some more later?"
62;279960;281410;"That might be difficult."
63;281410;283170;"I'm a busy man..."
64;283430;285180;"That's crap, Ging!"

70;298010;299520;"All you you, shut up!"
71;299520;300810;"It's none of your business!"
72;300810;302070;"You're a jerk, Ging!"
73;302320;304460;"You should apologize to Gon!"
74;304460;307710;"Promise him you'll act more like a father!"
75;307710;310370;"Hell, you don't have the right 
to say you're his father!"
76;310370;311580;"Make up your minds!"
77;311580;313080;"You can all screw yourselves!"
78;313310;316150;"You should have Leorio punch you again!"
79;316780;318130;"Yeah, just shut up!"
80;318130;319450;"Fine, then..."
81;319450;321960;"I'll be waiting, so get going!"
82;321960;323710;"How stupid do you think we are?"
83;323710;325250;"You take him there!"
84;325250;327350;"Aren't you his father?"
85;327350;328870;"Okay, fine!"
86;329220;330600;"I'll take you all on!"
87;330900;333600;"If you have a problem with 
what I'm doing, bring it on!"
88;334540;336690;"You're all against me? Okay!"
89;336690;338420;"That's fine by me!"
90;342720;344850;"Everyone!"
91;345090;347890;"Quiet down!"

can leave until the election is over."
98;371110;373440;"You're in a hurry, aren't you?"
99;373440;377510;"But this will be the final vote."
100;377510;379900;"Once you vote, you'll be allowed to leave."
101;380450;382620;"If you tell us your choice right now,"
102;382620;386400;"everyone here will accept that as a valid vote."
103;390570;393310;"Between myself, Pariston, and Leorio-san,"
104;393310;395910;"whom do you believe is most 
fit to become chairman?"
105;396610;398550;"I should mention that the 
former chairman, Netero,"
106;398550;402170;"is taking an extended vacation 
after defeating the Ant King."
107;403150;406400;"How can you say such a thing?"
108;407060;410770;"If Gon picks Leorio after his dramatic arrival,"
109;410770;413700;"everyone may get caught up in 
the heat of the moment again"
110;413700;416100;"and vote for Leorio."
111;417360;418740;"Chairman?"
112;418740;420490;"Leorio's running for chairman?"
113;420850;423450;"No! See, some stuff happened..."
114;424050;425190;"Gon-kun,"
115;425940;427980;"you can rely on your gut."
116;427980;430450;"Be true to your heart,"
117;430840;432870;"and pick one of us."
118;435780;438620;"Uh... Then,"
119;439430;440850;"I'll pick Pariston-san!"
120;442440;443330;"Huh?"
121;444410;447630;"Isn't Leorio-san your friend?"
122;447950;451010;"Shouldn't you pick him?"
123;451290;454650;"Nope, because Leorio wants 
to become a doctor,"
124;454650;456100;"so he can't be chairman!"
125;460350;461950;"Of course!"
126;463730;466330;"Now I've been completely defeated."
127;467800;469290;"Thank you, Gon-kun."
128;469770;472660;"Then let's begin the vote."
129;472830;474290;"Oh, sorry."
130;474290;475750;"I'm going with Gon."
131;476200;478220;"My vote goes to Pariston."
132;479720;480590;"Leorio..."
133;480930;482170;"I know."
134;483940;484760;"Ging!"
135;488150;489670;"I'm going now!"
136;491860;492680;"Yeah."
137;495070;497170;"Is that all you have to say, you idiot?"
138;497170;498700;"At least say, "See you later"!"
139;498700;499830;"Where's your common sense?"
140;501090;502180;"Ging's snapped!"

195;725180;727650;"Yeah, I'm really sorry."
196;738600;740920;"The requests following a wish for a computer"
197;740920;744190;"should be more severe than playing 
dead and a pat on the head."
198;749550;754130;"When I heard Milluki's report, 
that was the first thing that seemed off."

in a simple kiss on the cheek,"
200;759620;763510;"it demanded fingernails, a far too heavy price."

the price for the computer,"

204;775910;778300;"If my theory is correct,"
205;779000;783140;"playing dead and the pat on the head 
weren't requests from Something."
206;783140;788540;"Thus, the two-choice wish didn't require a payment."
207;789870;791870;"Why was that the case?"
208;792720;794690;"There are two possibilities."
209;795790;799170;"One, because the wish was simple enough"
210;799170;801350;"that Something's power wasn't required."
211;802810;804010;"Two,"
212;804420;806260;"because it wasn't a wish."
213;808320;811330;"However, there's still an unresolved question here."
214;812150;816200;"If playing dead and the pat on the head 
weren't requests from Something..."
215;817100;821600;"They were requests from Alluka, not Something."
216;823230;827080;"Killua claims that Something calls him "Killua,""
217;827550;831650;"and the request to play dead was made to "Brother.""
218;833170;837920;"Thus, the one who calls Killua "Brother" is Alluka."
219;839210;842710;"If the request came from Alluka,"
220;842710;844780;"then Something wasn't awake,"
221;844780;849360;"and Killua shouldn't have been 
able to make the two-choice wish."
222;850120;853950;"However, Something responded to Killua's wish."
223;855180;858690;"The hint to resolving this contradiction 
lies in the wording Killua used."
224;859050;861950;"When making the two-choice wish, 
Killua was not asking."
225;861950;863520;"He was commanding."
226;864250;867760;"It makes sense that a command 
would work differently than a wish,"
227;867760;872220;"and would not require a payment upon completion."
228;874110;876580;"Those are my conclusions."
229;876580;877770;"What do you think?"
230;883190;884910;"I'll get to the point."
231;885440;891020;"I'm the one who can use Something's power, 
effectively and safely, for the Zoldyck family."
232;892080;896670;"As it stands, Alluka is no more than 
a spirit locked forever in one room."
233;897520;900920;"But if I control him with you at his side,"
234;903840;907500;"at the very least, I can guarantee his freedom."
235;909510;910560;"Brother..."

250;976940;979010;"there is no need to worry about requests."

278;1101180;1102120;"I'm sorry..."
279;1108440;1109280;"Alluka?"
280;1119160;1121430;"Brother?"
281;1121910;1123850;"Yep, it's your big—"
282;1125480;1129060;"Did you make Something cry?"
283;1129060;1129960;"Huh?"
284;1129960;1132820;"Er, well..."
285;1133790;1136320;"She's still hunched over, crying!"
286;1136320;1138270;"Apologize to her!"
287;1139240;1140340;"But..."
288;1140340;1141700;"Apologize!"
289;1142410;1147220;"If you're nice to me, you have to 
be nice to Something, too!"
290;1156510;1161590;"If you're going to protect me, 
you have to protect Something, too!"
291;1165120;1169070;"If you're mean to Something, I'll hate you!"
292;1177280;1180320;"Alluka, thank you."
293;1181410;1185280;"I guess I was still under Ill-nii's control."
294;1186780;1189810;"But everything's okay now."
295;1191740;1194500;"Can you tell Something to come out?"
296;1210200;1212650;"Something, I'm sorry."
297;1213220;1214660;"I was wrong."
298;1215420;1216240;"I'm sorry!"
299;1217100;1219780;"I was scared of Ill-nii,"
300;1219780;1221130;"and I couldn't defy him."
301;1221130;1224690;"So I did what he said, and I hated it."
302;1225380;1228710;"When I realized he might force you"
303;1228710;1232720;"to do bad things, too, I got really scared..."
304;1234750;1237290;"For Alluka's sake, I lied to myself,"
305;1238200;1239800;"and I said mean things to you."
306;1241300;1243350;"I'm really sorry!"
307;1246300;1247180;"Something,"
308;1248030;1249900;"I'll protect you."
309;1249900;1251260;"We'll always be together!"
310;1251910;1254330;"Don't listen to wishes from anyone else anymore!"
311;1254330;1257010;"I'll pat you on the head whenever you want!"
312;1258210;1263390;"So would you please come out again?"
313;1276190;1277210;"'Kay..."
314;1284380;1285220;"Something,"
315;1286520;1289830;"will you forgive me for being a"
316;1291760;1293100;"bad big brother?"
317;1295030;1296010;"'Kay."
318;1302820;1303990;"I..."
319;1307020;1308240;"love Killua."
320;1310650;1315000;"Tsubone, I've rescinded the restriction on Killua."
321;1315500;1317790;"Please let him know."
322;1318600;1322600;"Yes, I understand."
323;1405330;1407170;"His first friend."
324;1407170;1409050;"Too many memories to speak of."
325;1409050;1411640;"A new journey."
326;1412180;1414760;"Next time: Salvation x And x Future."
