3;11390;16530;"My guess is that when I was a 
baby, I came here with Ging."

to clear the game..."

8;32910;35630;"Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!"

26;215310;217320;"You should be grateful, you idiot!"
27;225810;227000;"An ant?"
28;227340;228530;"Are you hurt?"
29;242760;245500;"Is that Ging?"
30;259260;260660;"That isn't Ging..."
31;263860;264880;"Hey..."
32;264880;266320;"What was that about?"
33;266970;270270;"First you push us down, then you fire at us!"
34;270270;271940;"Enough fooling around!"
35;272260;273570;"Fooling around?"
36;273570;275010;"I was being dead serious."
37;275470;279440;"If I hadn't opened fire, 
you would have been attacked."
38;279440;280660;"By what?!"
39;280660;282970;"The ant you shot?"
40;286430;287360;"Ow!"
41;289870;291390;"What is this?"
42;291720;292890;"Idiot!"
43;306150;308020;"That's no ordinary ant."
44;308020;309440;"It's a Chimera Ant."
45;309440;310840;"A Chimera Ant?"
46;310840;315680;"An aggressive, carnivorous insect, 
currently under class-1 quarantine."
47;316910;319720;"From time to time, they even attack humans."
48;320970;325110;"You were standing right in front of their nest."
49;325110;327420;"Had I not fired,"
50;327420;331250;"a Chimera Ant army would 
have consumed you by now."
51;335530;338910;"I feel like this has happened before..."
52;346340;348840;"Don't worry, it's not serious."
53;348840;350070;"Apply this."
54;350070;351240;"It's an antibiotic."

57;356610;358910;"Shut up... Go away."
58;360220;362420;"You should leave, as well."
59;363280;364350;"Damn..."
60;364350;367080;"Because of this interruption, 
I'll need to start over."
61;367080;369510;"But the nest was destroyed."
62;369820;372390;"Man, forced to take another life..."
63;372780;373520;"Ah!"
64;387160;391260;"Man, forced to take another life..."
65;394500;395830;"Are you..."
66;396240;397580;"Are you the one"
67;398230;400040;"who saved me back then?"
68;400690;401860;"Back then?"
69;402230;406690;"On Whale Island, after I stumbled into 
the territory of a Foxbear with its cub."
70;408120;409090;"Whale Island?"
71;409480;410770;"That time, too,"
72;410770;413810;"you had to kill, in order to protect me."
73;426590;429450;"Oh, yes. I remember now."
74;429860;432660;"I never expected to run into you again here."
75;433400;436330;"You've grown, Gon."
76;437550;439460;"How do you know my name?"
77;439460;441520;"I heard it from your dad,"
78;441520;442670;"Ging-san."
79;443470;445880;"Old man, you know Ging?"
80;445880;446860;"Old..."
81;449050;451250;"Yeah, my name is Kite."
82;451250;452840;"Ging-san was my master."
83;499590;504080;"Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?"
84;504080;506280;"Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?"
85;506280;507770;"Call me Kite."
86;507770;510300;"It's awkward being addressed 
formally by my master's son."
87;510730;511670;"Okay."
88;511670;513360;"Then, you're one too, Kite?"
89;513360;517990;"Yeah, Ging-san was the one who 
made me a top-class Hunter."
90;518400;521230;"He was my teacher and benefactor."
91;523360;525470;"If I hadn't met Ging-san,"
92;525470;530050;"I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum."
93;556610;558120;"Wait up!"
94;558490;559660;"Damned brat!"
95;560490;564790;"He swiped the bread that 
I'd managed to find..."
96;565090;567040;"He isn't escaping today."
97;594870;596480;"My bread!"
98;596480;597450;"Bastard,"
99;597450;598950;"you won't get away today!"
100;601680;602420;"Ow!"
101;602420;603830;"What is this?"
102;603830;604990;"What are you doing?"
103;604990;606120;"Stop it..."
104;669820;672700;"You live with these guys?"
105;672700;673650;"That sounds fun."
106;682900;686120;"That was how you met Ging?"
107;686920;687920;"Yeah..."
108;689150;693670;"Ging-san said that good Hunters 
are well-liked by animals."
109;694060;697890;"He said I had potential, so I got interested."
110;698420;699880;"And you became his student?"
111;699880;701780;"I had to force him to teach me."
112;701780;705420;"He hated dealing with any kind of hassle..."
113;705420;708500;"So I was never his student officially."
114;709830;712190;"But I was a stubborn one..."
115;712580;714520;"I kept bugging him."
116;715020;718570;"Eventually, I started to develop my <i>Nen</i>,"
117;718570;720570;"and he began teaching me to hunt."
118;721930;726580;"As a result, I was able to pass the 
Hunter Exam with little difficulty."
119;726960;732210;"But before Ging-san was satisfied, 
I had to clear another hurdle."
120;732900;734960;"Can you guess what it was?"
121;739010;741470;"I think I might know."
122;741810;742750;"Oh?"
123;742750;745220;"No, I definitely know."
124;746220;749340;"This is what Ging would have said..."
125;749640;751980;""Try to catch me.""
126;753950;756560;"Exactly. You're right."
127;757320;759360;"I knew it! I figured that was it!"
128;760570;764740;"But as far as I knew, he was 
the world's greatest Hunter."
129;764740;767520;"It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever."
130;767880;770960;"There were no clues or leads to begin from."
131;771360;774750;"And I didn't hear word of a single sighting."
132;775160;779880;"He'd managed to completely erase 
his existence from this world."
133;780740;783110;"<i>Like a super-powered form of</i> Zetsu?"
134;784510;785760;"So..."
135;786120;787510;"So what happened in the end?"
136;787510;791990;"I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue,"
137;791990;794020;"so I went to his home."
138;795020;796400;"To Whale Island."
139;797600;800610;"That was when I met you, Gon."
140;803150;806590;"But back then, I didn't realize"
141;806590;808850;"that you were Ging-san's son."
142;808850;812190;"I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san"
143;812190;815250;"and told him about what had 
happened on Whale Island."
144;822940;825780;"That was my kid... His name is Gon."
145;838150;840090;"Thanks for hitting him."
146;840990;843600;"It's common sense to avoid"
147;843600;846990;"Foxbear territory when they're raising young."
148;853260;855390;"Ging-san wasn't surprised"
149;855390;858830;"that I went to Whale Island, 
or that I met you there."
150;859470;862300;"It was almost as though he'd expected it."
151;863070;864580;"Looking back,"
152;864580;868100;"it may be that everything's gone 
according to Ging-san's plans."
153;868800;871150;"Are you saying he set all this up?"
154;871150;872550;"Well, I can't prove it."
155;875630;877140;"You might be right."
156;880120;882040;"Razor was waiting for me."
157;882690;884260;"And Dwun and List."
158;884770;886790;"Razor? Dwun?"
159;887570;890530;"Yeah, in a game called <i>Greed Island</i>..."
160;890530;892420;"It's a long story."
161;892420;897000;"In the game, a guy named Razor was 
waiting for me, at Ging's request."
162;897870;900480;"My son will come here one day."
163;900870;903040;"When that happens, give him a good beating."
164;903040;906520;"Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?"
165;906520;908260;"Don't get too cocky."
166;908260;909690;"He is my son."
167;912400;915160;"Then, I'm counting on you, Razor."
168;915880;919820;"Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends"
169;919820;922130;"who helped him create <i>Greed Island</i>."
170;922130;926470;"Oh, Razor was also one of them..."
171;926470;930420;"Anyway, those three were waiting for me."
172;930950;933780;"When I learned that, I realized something."
173;933780;940530;"If Ging planned for me to go to <i>Greed 
Island</i> and meet his friends,"
174;940530;947190;"meeting Bisky and the others may have 
been another part of his plan."
175;947190;948800;"In that case,"
176;949220;953640;"it's possible that Ging also planned 
that you'd meet Kite here."
177;953640;954470;"Huh?"
178;956300;957860;"Oh, that's right!"
179;958520;962000;"You must have been to <i>Greed Island</i> before."
180;962000;962990;"Me?"
181;962990;967010;"Yeah, did you register under the name "Nigg"?"
182;967010;968010;"Nigg?"
183;968320;970670;"No, I don't recall that name."
184;971040;972070;"Wait..."
185;972570;977830;"I do remember Ging-san taking 
me inside a game..."
186;977830;979270;"I knew it!"
187;979600;981130;"<i>Greed Island</i>..."
188;981130;983400;"Yes, I believe that was its title."
189;983740;986460;"But I can't remember if I used an alias."
190;986460;988230;"That must be it..."
191;988230;991100;"Ging must have had you use the name Nigg."
192;991100;994250;"Damn! He tricked me!"
193;994250;996470;"You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?"
194;1003490;1005730;"Are you sure this was the right decision,"
195;1006040;1006880;"Ging?"
196;1007950;1011410;"Can you make it so that using 
Magnetic Force will send Gon to me,"
197;1011410;1015330;"while using Accompany will send him to Kite?"
198;1015920;1017220;"I can..."
199;1017910;1019950;"Why do you want me to do that?"
200;1019950;1024500;"If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on 
his own, I'm willing to meet with him."
201;1024500;1028660;"But I can't meet him if he's so gutless 
that he has to bring friends."
202;1028660;1031280;"Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?"
203;1031280;1032560;"I don't understand."
204;1033010;1034930;"Never mind... Just do it!"
205;1034930;1037470;"You'd probably just be 
embarrassed if he brought a crowd."
206;1037470;1040220;"Shut up! Just do it!"
207;1043430;1045400;"He's so weird..."
208;1045400;1047230;"Shy and stubborn."
209;1047620;1049440;"I feel sorry for Gon-kun."
210;1053230;1054490;"I understand."
211;1054490;1060580;"So the game <i>Greed Island</i> was 
created to train you boys."
212;1061070;1062790;"Only Gon, really."
213;1063240;1065500;"I just tagged along for the ride."
214;1065500;1068880;"That may have been part of Ging's plan, too."
215;1068880;1069850;"Even me?"
216;1069850;1072330;"Nah, that's impossible."
217;1072330;1073260;"However,"
218;1073580;1077170;"it appears that our meeting 
here wasn't coincidence."
219;1077170;1079600;"Yeah, I agree."
220;1079940;1081890;"There must be a deeper meaning to this."
221;1081890;1083320;"Meaning?"
222;1083320;1086720;"Razor waited inside the 
game to make you stronger,"
223;1087150;1091520;"so one would think Ging must 
have some role for Kite to play."
224;1092340;1093530;"A role..."
225;1094680;1097730;"Your final test was finding Ging, right?"
226;1098140;1099200;"Yeah."
227;1099200;1101280;"That sounds like a daunting task."
228;1101690;1103990;"The best Hunters in this world"
229;1103990;1107790;"are masters of not only hunting, 
but concealing themselves as well."
230;1108330;1110050;"Yet you were able to find him."
231;1110050;1111120;"Oh..."
232;1111120;1113420;"Yeah, that's true."
233;1113690;1115950;"Once you cleared your final test,"
234;1115950;1119680;"Ging must have decided you were 
worthy of handling this."
235;1119680;1121900;"Handling this? Handling what?"
236;1122610;1125670;"Handling what? Basically..."
237;1133810;1135820;"Thanks for hitting him."
238;1139050;1140220;"Say, Gon..."
239;1141350;1144470;"Want me to tell you Ging-san's 
current whereabouts?"
240;1155640;1158090;"No, I'll find him on my own."
241;1159900;1161340;"A good response."
242;1163210;1165760;"Anyway, tell me about Ging."
243;1165760;1168520;"Tell me everything you know!"
244;1195380;1198550;"How to help two-headed wolves breed?"
245;1198550;1200740;"Ging is involved in that stuff?"
246;1200740;1205750;"Sure, Ging-san is involved with a 
wide range of Hunter activities."
247;1206440;1209160;"He's never formally applied 
because he doesn't want"
248;1209160;1213060;"to expend the energy, but he's as 
qualified as a Triple Star Hunter."
249;1213540;1214810;"Triple Star?"
250;1215250;1219060;"Stars are awarded to Hunters who 
perform extraordinary tasks."
251;1219430;1220500;"Those responsible for"
252;1220500;1225260;"historical discoveries or global 
achievements receive three stars."
253;1225540;1228710;"There are fewer than ten of 
these Hunters in the world."
254;1228710;1232460;"The title "Triple Star Hunter" 
is reserved for the very best."
255;1233880;1237600;"So Ging is as good as the best!"
256;1242590;1243760;"Kite..."
257;1244560;1247100;"A Hunter who earned Ging's respect."
258;1250460;1253350;"Ging-san is also famous"
259;1253350;1257800;"for discovering the Lurka Ruins 
and the Kongo gold vein."
260;1257800;1260990;"Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!"
261;1261750;1263430;"Kite, student of Ging..."
262;1263890;1265400;"While his meeting"
263;1265400;1269860;"with Gon and Killua signaled the 
beginning of a new adventure..."
264;1273340;1276790;"On the Yorbian continent, in the 
southernmost of the Balsa Islands,"
265;1277370;1280750;"a prologue to unparalleled fear"
266;1281580;1286430;"was quietly but steadily unfolding."
267;1288310;1289530;"Not enough."
268;1290200;1292770;"These creatures are not enough, 
no matter how many I eat."
269;1293150;1294810;"But I cannot move..."
270;1295740;1296940;"Stay calm."
271;1296940;1299900;"Focus on recovering my energy."
272;1300820;1303620;"I must heal before I can take the next step."
273;1307930;1310000;"I have a duty to fulfill..."
