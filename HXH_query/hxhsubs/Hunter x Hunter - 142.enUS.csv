1;2270;4990;"You removed the needle, didn't you?"
2;5940;6860;"Yeah."
3;7480;8860;"I feel a lot better."
4;10310;13360;"Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you."
5;13610;14590;"Kill?"
6;15440;16490;"Me?"
7;19760;23960;"You can't kill family members 
during an inner mission."
8;26000;27500;"<i>Family</i> is off limits."
9;31300;35010;"You shouldn't consider that thing 
to be a member of the family."
10;36790;39040;"They're all thinking"
11;40260;42160;"the same thing!"
12;45150;46680;"Fine..."
13;46680;48470;"I'll beat you at your own game."
14;128980;133980;"Needles x And x Debt"
15;139380;143740;"To save Gon, Killua is heading 
for the city with Alluka."
16;145320;149820;"Hisoka, who is working with Illumi to kill Alluka,"
17;149820;154310;"confronted Gotoh and the other 
butlers escorting them."
18;155350;159440;"A power that lets you rapidly fire coins 
with more power than bullets..."
19;162220;166520;"Your power is strong enough to explain why 
you'd send your subordinates away."
20;166860;171260;"My coins pack enough power that you 
can't escape unscathed if they hit."
21;171970;174270;"He must have used his power."
22;188930;194540;"My aura possesses the qualities 
of both gum and rubber."
23;197580;199500;"You've said too much."
24;199980;202800;"I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!"
25;207030;210060;"Telling my name to someone 
about to die is pointless."
26;211580;214810;"It doesn't matter that you 
know what my power is."
27;215530;216320;"Rubbish!"
28;233520;234830;"Catch."
29;236390;239360;"Were my eyes just accustomed 
to your attack that time?"
30;239730;241840;"It looked slower."
31;242310;244840;"Yeah, it was a lot slower."
32;252220;255600;"Because I diverted some 
power to make them spin."
33;264270;268370;"If you don't release your ability, 
you'll be strangled by your own aura."
34;269870;272270;"Or would you prefer your body riddled with holes?"
35;275880;277380;"Pick your poison."
36;280310;282630;"Bungee Gum, undo."
37;291150;294740;"He dodged my attack from that position?"
38;305880;306980;"He's fast."
39;307420;308410;"I can't follow him!"
40;309150;312990;"I sent my gum out with the first card..."
41;315030;317600;"So it would be ready to activate anytime"
42;317600;321770;"after I removed the gum from my feet."
43;328410;329480;"Now,"
44;329870;332780;"this evil magician has a lethal pop quiz for you."
45;336530;341450;"I took twenty-two coins from your attack."
46;342170;345440;"How many coins will I return to you?"
47;346570;350200;"He's going to use the gum to send 
the coins flying back at me?"
48;351700;355200;"You will have to find out for yourself."
49;355870;357710;"Gum, undo."
50;359900;361320;"You shouldn't underestimate me."
51;361860;364450;"Even if the answer is greater than twenty-two,"
52;364450;365960;"I'll shoot them all down!"
53;382570;384120;"The answer is"
54;384120;385670;"enough to kill you."
55;403880;407590;"A lethal pop quiz doesn't 
need to be answered."
56;432000;434950;"Forty kilometers until we reach the next town."
57;435340;436720;"I should last that long..."
58;437340;440130;"Alluka, you're gonna feel a little zap again."
59;440130;441960;"Okay, it's fine."
60;441960;443040;"Godspeed!"
61;445810;447460;"Speed of Lightning!"
62;453380;455280;"Very impressive..."
63;455800;461940;"If he runs at that speed on pavement, 
I won't be able to catch up on my own."
64;466800;469360;"Amane, it's me."
65;470110;473000;"Master Killua is headed for Parasta."
66;473000;474960;"I need you to follow the road."
67;476300;478240;"Canary, come with me."
68;479690;482620;"With my grandmother's motorcycle, 
it'll be faster with two riders."
69;497350;498490;"This is..."
70;498850;499820;"My grandmother."
71;501160;502890;"Hang on tight."
72;503430;505540;"We'll be using our auras as fuel,"
73;506090;508510;"so this will be more tiring than if you were to run."
74;508510;509700;"Be prepared."
75;511040;512400;"Here we go."
76;536280;537430;"Found them."
77;543680;545140;"Seriously?"
78;545140;546930;"I know I'm carrying Alluka,"
79;546930;549190;"but Speed of Lightning is at full power!"
80;552110;553390;"Damn!"
81;553390;554450;"If I go this way,"
82;554900;556610;"you can't follow on a motorcycle!"
83;561600;562600;"What now?"
84;563130;564880;"We'll beat him there."
85;564880;565960;"Beat him where?"
86;566330;571480;"At Master Killua's speed, it'll take less 
than ten minutes to reach Parasta."
87;571480;575440;"It'll take Master Illumi over twenty minutes by car."
88;575440;577720;"What will he do with his ten-minute lead?"
89;578740;579870;"Disguise himself?"
90;579870;582800;"Wrong. Cute answer..."
91;582800;585230;"Though not impossible, I suppose."
92;586390;590390;"What's the first thing Master Killua 
will want to do after he loses us?"
93;590390;592080;"Contact his friends."
94;592080;593610;"Bingo."
95;593610;597930;"And how can he contact his friends 
without us finding out?"
96;597930;599620;"Um..."
97;600080;603920;"He'll need to check for any 
tracing or listening devices,"
98;603920;605870;"and use someone else's phone."
99;605870;608490;"That's mere common sense."
100;608490;611460;"Think about what matters in this situation!"
101;612720;616780;"We may know where Master Killua is,"
102;616780;620410;"but if we can't get near him, 
we won't know what he's doing."
103;620410;622470;"So where is he going?"
104;627340;629480;"You've figured it out?"
105;630230;632060;"Let's go, then!"
106;659140;660880;"We've been waiting for you."
107;661520;664310;"Damn, you guys aren't bad."
108;664310;666660;"We've already prepared an airship."
109;667150;669550;"Great, how many?"
110;669550;670680;"Huh?"
111;670680;673250;"Sounds like you only have one."
112;673250;674650;"Are you serious about this?"
113;675250;680720;"Without at least five or six airships heading 
to different places, we'll never lose Illumi!"
114;680720;683160;"Split up, and make the arrangements."
115;683790;685790;"This airship will take us to our destination."
116;685790;686940;"Is that okay?"
117;686940;687730;"Yes."
118;688680;692790;"We'll have to pay for two tickets, 
or they'll figure out it's unmanned."
119;692790;695250;"I know that! Do you take me for a fool?"
120;696890;698770;"What does this say?"
121;698770;701140;"Ask the clerk."
122;701140;703110;"What names should we put the tickets under?"
123;703110;706090;"Look, can't you do anything by yourself?"
124;708120;709570;"Where's Master Killua?"
125;716010;717880;"Crap!"
126;718560;722570;"Hey! You were pestering me as a distraction, 
weren't you? You helped them escape!"
127;723210;724770;"What are you talking about?"
128;725260;728370;"We have to follow them!"
129;728370;729670;"I'll let you handle that."
130;730800;735270;"Once I've dispatched the other 
flights, I'll ride one of them."
131;735270;739330;"If you follow them on the ground, 
be sure you aren't followed."
132;739330;740860;"What are you talking about?"
133;740860;744840;"If you follow them by air, it'll be more obvious!"
134;744840;747010;"That wasn't my plan."
135;747010;748660;"I can serve as a decoy."
136;748660;753960;"And since I plan to join up with Gotoh, 
it'll be easier to move by airship."
137;759450;760760;"What is it?"
138;760760;762890;"The real you is pretty cute."
139;764800;768020;"I'm sure that Master Killua will 
like you more that way."
140;768020;770320;"A-Are you making fun of me?"
141;770320;771370;"Nope."
142;772280;773370;"I really mean it."
143;794310;795440;"Gotoh..."
144;801840;803650;"Hello? It's me, Killua."
145;804100;806060;"Oh, what happened?"
146;806060;807520;"I was getting worried."
147;807890;810000;"I can't get in touch with Gotoh-san."
148;810000;812660;"Got it. I'll try calling him."
149;817090;819000;"Your older brother wants to 
kill your younger brother?"
150;819440;820040;"Yeah."
151;821000;824570;"Alluka's the only one who can heal Gon."
152;824570;828050;"But Illumi wants to kill Alluka."
153;828530;833230;"Because he thinks that my wish may 
end up wiping out the entire family."
154;844650;846820;"We were too late..."
155;847500;851300;"Why don't we just wait for 
them around the hospital?"
156;851300;856130;"The closer we get to the hospital, 
the more likely we are to fail."
157;856130;859580;"Killua's friends will be in the vicinity."
158;860430;865090;"And if we just hang around waiting, 
they'll realize something isn't right."
159;867770;871340;"Eight... We need more people."
160;871340;873330;"Will you bring in more allies?"
161;874660;877320;"But I'm pretty shy..."
162;877320;879990;"No, I have no more allies."
163;879990;882860;"Seems like a waste, but I guess I'll use my needles."
164;894350;896870;"That's some nice aura."
165;900200;904080;"If I stick them in someone and give orders, 
they'll work hard for me until death."
166;904540;907890;"Though, they usually die from working too hard."
167;909640;911430;"Grant a wish?"
168;911430;914760;"That's a pretty scary power."
169;915550;919020;"If segregationists knew about 
that, they'd be all over it."
170;920380;923470;"Illumi will probably follow the airships by ground."
171;923470;926530;"My butlers have dispatched seven decoys."
172;927290;929820;"My brother doesn't usually rely on others,"
173;929820;931840;"so he'll probably use Needlemen."
174;932200;933530;"Needlemen?"
175;934310;936660;"He uses special needles, which carry <i>Nen</i>,"
176;937390;939700;"to create soldiers that fight to the death for him."
177;943770;946320;"He sacrifices ordinary civilians to do it."
178;950090;952800;"Illumi's powerful aura enters 
the victims through the needles,"
179;953350;956960;"so the moment they're pierced, 
they turn into vegetables."
180;965230;967130;"Morel, I need you to get some Hunters"
181;967130;969700;"to take the Needlemen into custody."
182;970210;975050;"If we have proof that he's harmed 
multiple innocent civilians beyond recovery,"
183;977000;980340;"then it's okay to hunt him down, 
even if he's a pro Hunter, right?"
184;983050;989350;"Killua sought this confirmation because of 
what the fourth Hunter Commandment said."
185;990780;993220;"Hunter Commandment #4..."
186;993220;997440;"A Hunter may never target another Hunter."
187;997440;1004010;"However, this does not apply to Hunters 
who commit heinous criminal acts."
188;1006850;1010660;"I believe some of the candidates were talking about"
189;1010660;1013760;"changing the Commandments and Hunter Exam."
190;1014960;1016630;"If we catch Illumi,"
191;1016630;1020740;"a lot of people who agree with 
those views will come forward."
192;1021900;1025870;"Killua, are you really going to sell your brother out?"
193;1027180;1031270;"I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt Alluka."
194;1032740;1035390;"Not even if he's my own brother."
195;1035960;1038010;"I'll do whatever it takes"
196;1039870;1041520;"to crush him."
197;1043550;1044740;"I understand."
198;1046510;1050320;"Teradein and Bushidora will 
probably agree to help."
199;1050980;1053900;"There should be many Hunters 
who will gladly lend a hand."
200;1054620;1060550;"Since you're coming to the city 
where the Hunter Association HQ is,"
201;1060550;1062500;"you'll be right under our noses."
202;1064570;1069160;"But I'll make sure everyone understands 
how dangerous our opponent is."
203;1069710;1073670;"The mission will be to secure the 
Needlemen, not to go after Illumi."
204;1075010;1077030;"Yeah, that's fine."
205;1080250;1084060;"I've accessed Parasta Airport's flight records."
206;1084060;1090270;"There are six airships landing within twenty 
to thirty kilometers of the hospital."
207;1090710;1094370;"We don't know where Killua 
and his butlers will land."
208;1094900;1098010;"And Illumi can't pursue what he can't see."
209;1099000;1102330;"Illumi and the Needlemen will try to 
stay in visual range of the airships,"
210;1102330;1104530;"as they follow on the ground."
211;1105110;1109150;"They will be vulnerable to attack 
at a number of points before"
212;1109150;1112180;"they reach Swaldani City, where the hospital is."
213;1112180;1114530;"So we need to send Hunters to those points."
214;1115870;1119950;"Our top priority is recovering the Needlemen."
215;1119950;1122100;"We can confirm if there are needles afterward."
216;1122100;1124550;"Capture anyone who approaches the airship!"
217;1124550;1125460;"Yes, sir!"
218;1125940;1127350;"Be on your way!"
219;1127350;1128480;"Go!"
220;1135050;1137830;"Hisoka, can you dispose of the fakes for me?"
221;1137830;1139240;"Okay."
222;1139780;1141530;"I will be busy."
223;1145620;1150750;"I always knew the fourth Commandment 
was fundamentally wrong."
224;1151340;1154720;"We can't wait for a villain like this to appear!"
225;1154720;1157840;"The Association's honor will be sullied."
226;1158290;1161390;"The exam needs to be more strict."
227;1162010;1165170;"If they were required to behave 
properly before joining,"
228;1165170;1167360;"we wouldn't have this problem."
229;1167360;1168650;"So the time has come..."
230;1169170;1172180;"For the three of us, the anti-chairman faction,"
231;1172180;1174650;"to leave the Association."
232;1174770;1178650;"{\fad(905,1)}Heart <font color="#434340">Is Valuable</font>"
233;1176410;1178650;"Hello, everyone."
234;1178900;1185410;"Today, I—Teradein—Loupe, and 
Bushidora have joined forces."
235;1186540;1190200;"We three are commonly known 
as the anti-chairman faction,"
236;1190200;1192420;"but that is not a name of our choice."
237;1193480;1200920;"The Hunter souls within us were inherited 
from the former chairman, I assure you."
238;1202350;1205910;"And so, to carry out his will,"
239;1205910;1214150;"we seek to reform the highly versatile team 
to which the former chairman belonged,"
240;1214650;1219690;"Seirin Group"
241;1215960;1219680;"the legendary Seirin Group."
242;1220400;1222200;"Teradein, the leader."
243;1222830;1224340;"Loupe, the second-in-command."
244;1225310;1230950;"And I, Bushidora, will serve 
as captain of the troops."
245;1231610;1235950;"In this election, as an expression of our solidarity,"
246;1235950;1240460;"we request that all votes go 
to Teradein, the leader."
247;1241140;1244650;"We hope that everyone who agrees"
248;1244650;1248840;"with our message will vote 
for our comrade Teradein."
249;1250470;1253980;"Now, as we address our message,"
250;1254390;1259230;"we have received trustworthy 
information from a reliable source"
251;1259230;1266070;"stating that multiple parties have found 
a certain Hunter guilty of many foul crimes."
252;1267140;1271500;"We are currently pursuing this Hunter."
253;1273330;1275000;"Ladies and gentlemen,"
254;1275650;1282550;"let us come together to rebuild the 
Hunter Association with wisdom and integrity!"
255;1302010;1306720;"And so, the conflict within 
the Zoldyck family over Alluka"
256;1306720;1312040;"grows in intensity as it now involves 
the Hunter Association chairman election."
257;1404590;1408380;"Teradein and his allies seek 
to control the Association."
258;1408380;1412720;"As the election continues, 
Illumi manages to capture Killua."
259;1412720;1415240;"Next time: Sin x And x Claw."
