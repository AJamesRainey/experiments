to become the predator."

4;16920;17970;"Really?"
5;19450;21800;"I barely felt a thing."
6;21800;26500;"You could punch us like that a few 
thousand times without killing us."
7;28300;29910;"I get it."

9;38010;41350;"You're swinging long after the ball's 
already in the catcher's mitt."

using my full strength."
11;44680;46970;"I can run faster and throw harder punches."
12;51400;52740;"This is a surprise."
13;53380;56280;"He's actually aiming for my face."
14;57790;61550;"I was certain his eyes couldn't 
even follow my motion earlier..."
15;62070;63080;"Just a lucky guess?"
16;66320;67040;"Him, too..."
17;67750;70750;"He's clearly ascertaining where 
I'm going to be before he attacks."

19;74550;77550;"They've adapted to my speed that quickly?"

27;190320;192040;"With guns? Numbers?"
28;194280;196170;"We'll use wit and experience."
29;201800;204130;"Where did this stuff come from?"

31;207700;208680;"Poison gas?"
32;208680;210180;"Or sleeping gas?"
33;210890;214070;"No, they're standing within it."

36;218960;220570;"You can retreat if you want."
37;221900;224430;"Does that mean you aren't running away?"
38;225070;227080;"Then this is a smokescreen."
39;227640;230110;"They'll use it as cover for their attack."
40;230530;233520;"Well, let's see what they can do..."

48;259240;261790;"I'll admit that you caught me off-guard,"

66;330500;335020;"Well, we're dealing with 
a level-one soldier ant."
67;335630;339520;"With APR on him, we can easily track him."
68;340020;343940;"We just need to chase him down, 
 box him in, and that'll be the end."
69;343940;348030;"But doesn't your ability lose its effect 
if the target moves too far away?"
70;348690;350970;"It'll stop adding interest,"
71;350970;352540;"but the effect will remain."
72;352990;357310;"Once I'm back in range, 
the counter will start up again."

he'll be easy to finish off."

76;364780;366880;"We may know what pitch he'll use,"
77;366880;369930;"but we still can't put the bat on the ball."
78;370580;374880;"Let's leave him for a <i>Nen</i> user who's 
better equipped to handle him."
79;374880;375930;"You're right."
80;376570;379020;"I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua..."

108;619460;622970;"You're going to let this beating continue?"
109;623610;626390;"Gon can't use <i>Nen</i> to defend himself either, right?"
110;626850;629720;"It's okay, Gon will notice."

167;901860;903620;"I would agree that Killua is capable,"

169;906340;910510;"At the very end, I was impressed 
by the way he moved."
170;911240;915150;"But he hasn't shown any fire since."
171;916070;919800;"And he clearly isn't focused during training."
172;920300;924240;"I believe his performance is quite inconsistent."
173;924240;927990;"But he's consistently inconsistent."
174;928670;933310;"He only gets serious when he absolutely must."
175;933310;938000;"I think his lack of drive these past few 
weeks will actually give him a boost."
176;938000;939450;"A boost?"
