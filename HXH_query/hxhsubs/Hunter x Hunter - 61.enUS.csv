270;903140;905810;"If no one can find a way to beat it,"
271;905810;907550;"the killing will only continue."
272;908410;910940;"That's why we're trying to end this mess."
273;910940;913050;"We're recruiting allies to clear this game."
274;913400;914810;"We need your help."
275;916500;918310;"How do you plan to obtain cards?"
276;918450;920430;"1) Find them yourself."
277;920430;922060;"2) Trade for them."
278;922380;924090;"3) Steal them."
279;924090;925440;"Which method will you use?"
280;926430;927320;"3..."
281;927570;930620;"I assume you mean to use all three methods,"
282;930620;932680;"but 3 will be the primary method."
283;932680;935830;"What, so you'll still use force?"
284;935830;936760;"No!"
285;936760;939450;"We won't use violence to reach our goal."
286;939890;940670;"Spells."
287;941590;942810;"You'll use spells."
288;942810;943580;"Am I right?"
289;943890;945080;"Correct."
290;946680;949570;"There are certain spells for taking cards,"
291;949570;951950;"and there are cards that 
defend against those spells."
292;951950;954600;"We'll focus on monopolizing these cards."
293;955050;958570;"We're going to use the very 
card transformation limit"
294;958570;960100;"that's frustrated the players."
295;960310;963180;"This is the only way to clear the game."
296;963180;967100;"I have met many players, and they 
all reached the same conclusion."
297;967570;970620;"Even if you search for cards, 
they'll be taken from you eventually."
298;971550;975620;"Because this game is based on 
players taking cards from each other."
299;976180;978780;"We will ensure that we can take 
cards from other players,"
300;978780;980790;"while mitigating our risk of losing cards."
301;981700;984720;"You're leaving out something important."
302;984720;988250;"Upon clearing the game, 
how will you split the reward?"
303;988620;992260;"You were hired by Mr. Battera, right?"
304;992700;994900;"So you knew who we were when you invited us."
305;994900;995600;"Yeah."
306;996290;999630;"Mr. Battera also hired us to play this game."
307;999630;1002470;"That means the reward will be 50 billion."
308;1002790;1005020;"We'll split it among everyone who helps."
309;1005440;1007730;"Currently, we have fifty-three players."
310;1008230;1010880;"It'll take two months to collect 
the remaining spell cards,"
311;1011420;1013030;"and one month to get the cards we need."
312;1013630;1014980;"We can finish in three months."
313;1015760;1018530;"Of course, if you join us,"
314;1018530;1021520;"we'll remove any spells cast on you."
315;1024430;1025290;"I'm in."
316;1025670;1028890;"I don't like the idea of splitting the 50 billion."
317;1028890;1032300;"But I like the three month schedule 
for clearing the game."
318;1032760;1033830;"What about you?"
319;1034740;1035970;"I have a question."
320;1036440;1041560;"If I obtain an SS rank card on 
my own, what's my cut?"
321;1041900;1045940;"Naturally, you'd receive 500 million 
for a card of that rank."
322;1047350;1049320;"Okay, I'm in."
323;1050000;1051820;"What about you two?"
324;1053220;1055070;"Killua, sorry."
325;1055070;1057070;"Hmm? What?"
326;1058050;1059220;"I'm out."
327;1059890;1061580;"I'm playing this game on my own."
328;1065570;1067490;"You heard the leader."
329;1067490;1068830;"I have to pass."
330;1069590;1071590;"Hey, Gon! Wait up..."
331;1074200;1075470;"What about you?"
332;1078630;1080750;"We'll need you to first exit the game,"
333;1080750;1083810;"so the spells placed on you can be removed."
334;1084160;1088580;"Once you're back in the game, 
wait by the starting point."
335;1088580;1090310;"We'll come get you."
336;1090930;1093860;"If you have any cards in your free slots,"
337;1093860;1095760;"give them to me now."
338;1096080;1096760;"Why?"
339;1097230;1099000;"When you leave the game,"
340;1099000;1102830;"the cards in your free slots disappear."
341;1103050;1106310;"I believe your data automatically 
saves when cards are"
342;1106310;1108400;"put in or removed from restricted slots."
343;1108400;1110350;"Yes, but your data disappears"
344;1110350;1113460;"if you don't return within ten days."
345;1113730;1119110;"If you don't return before then, 
we'll assume that you gave up."
346;1119110;1120090;"Got it?"
347;1121540;1124100;"Don't worry, we're being joined by an ally."
348;1127100;1128890;"We don't know if anyone's watching."
349;1129390;1130350;"Let's get started."
350;1131000;1133860;"Leave 

Send one 
target player 
off the island. 

[SR][NORM]"
351;1131240;1133860;"I'll be using the Leave card."
352;1135090;1137610;"Hey, Gon..."
353;1137610;1139810;"Will you explain what that was about?"
354;1144210;1145680;"Sorry, Killua."
355;1145680;1147910;"I couldn't take it anymore."
356;1147910;1151000;"I still don't get why you're apologizing."
357;1151000;1155600;"But this means you'll be stuck 
with that spell for a while."
358;1155600;1157800;"Oh, that's why."
359;1157800;1159260;"It's not a big deal."
360;1159260;1162130;"But you're playing this game"
361;1162130;1164770;"to help me find my dad..."
362;1166360;1167390;"You're wrong."
363;1167980;1170110;"I'm playing this game because..."
364;1170790;1173520;"Anyway, why were you so mad?"
365;1173810;1178050;"Because they had nothing 
but bad things to say about"
366;1178050;1182030;"the game Ging made, like how 
it's based on killing and stealing."
367;1182740;1186850;"I want to do what Ging said, 
and enjoy the game."
368;1187330;1189190;"When I first started,"
369;1189190;1192040;"I knew it wouldn't be easy."
370;1192380;1197600;"That was because I thought all the 
players enjoyed playing the game."
371;1198500;1200230;"People have died."
372;1200660;1204840;"But it's the player mentality, 
not the game, that scares me."
373;1204840;1208550;"They're willing to hurt others to get cards."
374;1208960;1209870;"Really?"
375;1209870;1211430;"I think it makes sense."
376;1212320;1214370;"Killua, you really mean that?"
377;1214370;1217470;"That's why this game is meant for Hunters."
378;1217470;1218420;"But..."
379;1218420;1219940;"Killing is wrong."
380;1219940;1221450;"I agree with you on that part."
381;1222050;1225510;"But what if two players have a fair 
fight with predetermined rules,"
382;1225510;1228480;"and the winner gets to take a card?"
383;1228480;1230130;"Th-That's acceptable."
384;1230130;1230830;"See?"
385;1231200;1233300;"When that guy cast a spell on me"
386;1233300;1235430;"and when those guys carry out their plan,"
387;1235430;1237840;"they're just following the game's rules."
388;1238920;1239820;"Yeah."
389;1240090;1242840;"Though it does still feel lame."
390;1243120;1246050;"Well, forget about them."
391;1246050;1248160;"Let's enjoy this game."
392;1249440;1250480;"Killua..."
393;1250480;1250980;"Hmm?"
394;1251970;1252980;"Thanks."
395;1254400;1256630;"I'm glad you came with me."
396;1256630;1257480;"No..."
397;1258310;1261630;"I'm glad I got to know you!"
398;1262450;1263920;"Cut it out, stupid."
399;1263920;1264790;"You're embarrassing me."
400;1264790;1267990;"Why? I really mean it."
401;1270420;1271490;"You've got it backwards."
402;1272350;1274270;"Gon, I should thank you."
403;1275140;1278660;"I'm the one who's glad"
404;1278660;1279910;"that I got to know you..."
405;1281750;1282910;"I understand."
406;1282910;1284220;"So that's why."
407;1285650;1290360;"Such a beautiful thing, the friendship 
and innocence of two young boys."
408;1291240;1294810;"I feel like messing with them."
409;1298250;1301470;"Gon and Killua have 
reaffirmed their friendship."
410;1302380;1307480;"But who is the girl watching them?"
411;1381150;1388150;"G.I. Tutorial"
412;1381610;1384750;"Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!"
413;1386910;1389310;"Today, we introduce the card Return."
414;1388240;1399250;"Return 

Warp to a city 
of your choice. 
(Must be a city 
you have visited.) 

[LR][NORM]"
415;1389310;1391610;"This travel card lets you instantly warp"
416;1391610;1394370;"to a city you've visited before."
417;1394370;1395330;"Return on!"
418;1395330;1396650;"Mito-san's place."
419;1396650;1398300;"It only works for places inside the game."
420;1398300;1399250;"Huh?"
421;1399380;1401250;"Continue!"
422;1406810;1409630;"Next time: Reality x And x Raw."
423;1409630;1411820;"If you polish a raw diamond, you can make it shine!"
424;1411820;1413180;"Hey, a shooting star!"
425;1413180;1414350;"Shiny."
