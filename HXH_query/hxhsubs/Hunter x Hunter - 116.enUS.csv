order to defeat the Chimera Ant King."
2;22870;25290;"My attacks don't work?"
3;25890;27330;"What is this thing?"
4;30610;32020;"Don't you run!"
5;32020;33090;"Answer me!"
6;33640;35200;"What is this thing?!"
7;39860;43480;"I ain't gonna tell you, fool!"
8;44170;46600;"If you wanna know, catch me first!"
9;49440;53150;"To save the injured Shoot,"
10;53150;56610;"Knuckle taunted Youpi to draw his attention."
11;68570;71910;"Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone..."
12;73030;78640;"I can't weave through those 
blades of death to get to him!"
13;79390;80360;"In that case..."
14;82900;87140;"I must not lose consciousness..."

19;117070;120530;"I can still..."
20;125270;128440;"Right now, my job..."
21;130940;133400;"isn't to help Shoot!"
22;135070;138010;"It's to use my power to help the others,"
23;138010;141500;"so they can complete their 
missions as fast as possible!"
24;142880;146690;"Though it broke his heart, 
Meleoron had to leave the two Hunters"
25;146690;150500;"and follow Gon and Killua instead, 
in order to fulfill his mission."
26;150500;155620;"Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into 
the depths of the palace to rescue Palm."
27;161170;162830;"Satellite Dragonflies!"
28;171570;173360;"I'm gonna rescue her."
29;174010;175860;"Palm is a friend of a friend."
30;176860;178240;"That makes her a friend..."
31;179360;180810;"My friend!"
32;182590;186290;"As Morel, the first Hunter 
to reach the throne room,"
33;186290;190790;"waited to continue his battle with Pouf, 
who remained in his cocoon,"
34;190790;194250;"Netero and the King were leaving the palace,"
35;194250;199370;"and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou,"
36;199370;202020;"their target for avenging Kite."
37;284010;289010;"Revenge x And x Recovery"
38;354040;355170;"Do you"
39;356680;358280;"remember me?"
40;366730;368770;"I'm Gon Freecss!"
41;369650;371600;"I came here"
42;372380;374350;"to get Kite back from you!"
43;379500;383360;"Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said."
44;383950;387120;"The only thing on Pitou's mind was 
surviving the current threat"
45;387120;389760;"while carrying out the King's order."
46;390230;394180;"Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task."
47;399690;401630;"I must protect Komugi..."
48;402530;403940;"At any cost!"
49;408550;409630;"Something's not right."
50;410180;413890;"Watching from a short distance, Killua 
noticed that something was strange."
51;415200;420080;"Why isn't the enemy preparing for 
battle when we're right here?"
52;421330;423650;"I can't sense any aura at all..."
53;424540;428650;"Pitou might as well be completely 
naked... Utterly defenseless."
54;429720;433650;"Does Pitou think it can win without aura?"
55;434380;436160;"No, that isn't possible."
56;437420;440760;"The aura coming from Gon now 
doesn't even compare to his usual."
57;441280;445400;"Even Pitou can't fight that without using</i> Nen."
58;446660;448270;"Is it because of where we are?"
59;449340;452700;"Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,"
60;452700;456480;"there'll be time to activate </i>Nen<i> if we do attack?"
61;457280;458660;"That's possible."
62;459980;462480;"However, for some reason..."
63;462940;464290;"That doesn't seem to be it."
64;465200;466510;"It almost looks like..."
65;467010;467970;"That's it."
66;469630;471000;"It looks like..."
67;473840;475300;"a mother"
68;476100;479600;"using its own body to guard something weaker."
69;481160;482470;"That's ridiculous."
70;482890;485380;"Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!"
71;486120;489250;"But then, why did Grandpa..."
72;490600;494080;"I'll let you draw your own conclusions 
about what's happening inside."
73;497890;499890;"...say something that cryptic?"
74;502330;507000;"While Killua was fighting his natural instincts,"
75;507000;511190;"the girl lying before them brought back"
76;511190;513860;"images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind."
77;528340;531380;"Get away from her."
78;538530;543390;"I'm telling you to take that 
monster and get away from her."
79;546710;549270;"And then, fight me!"
80;550010;552170;"Fight me, so I can get Kite back!"
81;569140;574670;"The act of placing both palms face-up 
to display one's lack of malice"
82;575470;578170;"was a gesture Killua recognized..."
83;606250;607080;"Please"
84;608450;609330;"wait."
85;618220;619910;"What the hell?!"
86;620610;622860;"What am I supposed to wait for?"
87;627120;629600;"Get up! We're going outside!"
88;631250;633610;"Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance"
89;634140;637910;"left Gon without a target for his rage."
90;638910;643110;"Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully 
understanding the current situation."
91;643110;643870;"It was..."
92;646760;649660;"I know nothing beyond the mission I received."
93;651160;655200;"He was saying something 
unexpected happened!"
94;656190;659260;"Grandpa knew nothing when 
he brought the dragon down."
95;660260;663100;"Grandpa's mission was probably"
96;663100;668460;"to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to 
separate the King and Royal Guard."
97;669590;672290;"But he didn't know that she was here, too."
98;674080;677110;"Wait, this woman must be"
99;678340;682320;"the third party that none of us knew about!"
100;686220;689370;"And she's most likely"
101;689370;692060;"the reason the King hurt himself."
102;692620;695320;"Why would the King do something 
so out of character?"
103;697880;702580;"Because she is someone 
who's special to the King."
104;703490;706200;"Pitou isn't taking her apart."
105;707240;709750;"Pitou is healing her at the King's command!"
106;711040;714730;"Pitou isn't only prevented from using
</i> En <i>when healing someone."
107;715290;718840;"All aura must be focused on 
healing ability when using it."
108;721070;726450;"However, Killua knew that this 
information would only have"
109;726450;728500;"a negative effect on Gon."
110;731510;733040;"What do I do?"
111;733700;734830;"What do I tell him?"
112;740730;741260;"Go—"
113;741260;742090;"I'll do anything!"
114;743770;746190;"I'll do anything you say!"
115;747360;748720;"So please wait."
116;749520;750100;"I..."
117;751290;754320;"must save this person!"
118;765350;766450;"Save..."
119;768250;770860;"Save what?"
120;771750;772850;""Anything"?"
121;773510;775110;"When you say "anything"..."
122;775110;775870;"Killua..."
123;777130;778880;"I'm asking the questions."
124;784800;788190;"What is it that you must save?"
125;800460;805650;"Amidst the extreme tension, 
the answer Pitou chose to give was..."
126;807270;810410;"This person is someone..."
127;811380;815790;"Someone who's important 
to someone important to me."
128;816650;818810;"...the truth."
129;820640;824000;"She is the reason the King is who he is."
130;825350;829630;"If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is."
131;830270;831340;"She's that important."
132;832230;833180;"So..."
133;834220;837820;"All I care about is saving her!"
134;838960;843830;"Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want."
135;844690;846110;"So please wait!"
136;851250;853990;"You want to save her?"
137;856010;857970;"You must save her?"
138;859440;861220;"Save her?"
139;881370;885360;"How dare you say that..."
140;887200;888740;"How dare you?!"
141;894090;895380;"Damn it!"
142;896430;897580;"The hell if..."
143;898840;903740;"The hell if I'll listen to you!"
144;909030;910630;"Gon, hold on!"
145;913160;917140;"It's likely that we were 
the ones that injured her."
146;918250;920090;"It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive."
147;921210;922150;"And?"
148;922580;928240;"Pitou is probably telling the 
truth about healing her."
149;928970;929900;"So?"
150;930590;933260;"Let's wait until it's done."
151;937440;938490;""Likely"?"
152;939320;940160;""Probably"?"
153;941930;944510;"You want me to wait because 
of "likely" and "probably"?"
154;945290;949920;"And after we wait, it's likely that this thing"
155;949920;951880;"will do what I want?"
156;954310;956740;"Likely? Probably?"
157;957100;957930;"Seriously?!"
158;958790;959930;"That's crap!"
159;960590;962390;"That's just crap!"
160;964010;966690;"Is something wrong with you?!"
161;967030;972700;"You want... You want me to trust this thing?!"
162;972700;974950;"I can't do that!"
163;989060;992380;"If you want, you may also have my right arm..."
164;993670;995720;"If that isn't enough,"
165;998210;1000220;"you can take both legs..."
166;1008300;1014420;"If you're worried I'll change my mind 
after the healing finishes,"
167;1015060;1020740;"you can break any part of my body 
that isn't required to heal her."
168;1021610;1025370;"Please let me save her!"
169;1059500;1060770;"That isn't fair..."
170;1061500;1063540;"That isn't fair, damn it!"
171;1064260;1066540;"Why are you helping her,"
172;1066900;1071300;"after everything you did to Kite?!"
173;1071300;1072270;"Gon!"
174;1072270;1073820;"Why?!"
175;1076040;1079300;"Why?!"
176;1115840;1117580;"To hell with that."
177;1125430;1127590;"First comes—"
178;1127590;1129600;"Gon, if you kill Pitou,"
179;1130260;1132110;"we'll never get Kite back."
180;1153630;1155430;"You have it easy, Killua."
181;1157220;1159120;"You're perfectly calm."
182;1161890;1164370;"Since it means nothing to you..."
183;1178370;1181400;"I'm only saying this because 
you're out of control."
184;1182670;1185330;"Did you forget the first thing 
you said when we came here?"
185;1186790;1188540;"We're here to get Kite back!"
186;1189110;1191040;"Pull it together!"
187;1203770;1204780;"Yeah."
188;1206550;1208130;"I'm okay now."
189;1227130;1228240;"How long?"
190;1228890;1230330;"How long do I have to wait?"
191;1233010;1235330;"To completely heal her"
192;1235880;1238090;"will take three to four hours."
193;1238570;1240340;"No, I can't wait that long."
194;1245840;1248100;"If I have an hour,"
195;1248910;1252050;"I can heal her most critical injuries."
196;1253520;1256200;"Please give me that."
197;1262620;1268370;"In one hour, you're coming with 
me to Peijing, to heal Kite."
198;1269320;1270870;"Can you promise me that?"
199;1272290;1274870;"I swear to keep that promise!"
200;1284160;1286940;"I'll wait right here for one hour."
201;1404630;1407040;"Next time: Insult x And x Payback."
202;1407040;1410050;"I can't think of anything right now..."
203;1410050;1412620;"Killua, insult me back!"
204;1412620;1414460;"I... feel better now."
