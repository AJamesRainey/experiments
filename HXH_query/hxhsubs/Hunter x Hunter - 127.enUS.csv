2;9290;12960;"Meruem... That is your name."
3;16580;19250;"What is this?"
4;21320;23370;"Meruem, King of Ants,"
5;24240;27210;"you understand nothing..."
6;31100;35150;"of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!"
7;39320;40360;"I see now..."
8;41720;43520;"Yes... I see..."
9;47350;48830;"You had me in checkmate"
10;50180;51330;"from the start..."
11;131980;137030;"Hostility x And x Determination"
12;151870;155860;"The bomb was both low-budget and compact,"
13;155860;158300;"while also proving surprisingly lethal."
14;159250;162300;"With the right technology,"
15;162300;165490;"it was possible to quickly mass 
produce these bombs."
16;166020;168660;"Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,"
17;169670;173580;"it was called the Miniature Rose, 
or the poor man's rose,"
18;173580;176160;"and was popular with small dictatorships."
19;179720;184410;"In more than 250 countries and regions of the world,"
20;184410;186830;"ten times as many roses had bloomed,"
21;187330;190540;"consuming 5.12 million human lives."
22;255930;260580;"After terrorists used the bomb in the 
center of an adversarial nation's capital,"
23;261250;265020;"taking more than 110,000 lives,"
24;265520;270410;"an international treaty was signed that 
banned the bomb's production."
25;271170;275420;"However, over eighty percent of the 
world's countries rejected the proposal"
26;275990;279420;"to discard and ban the use of 
roses they had already produced,"
27;280510;283920;"meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds"
28;284630;289790;"still wait silently in many countries 
for their chance to bloom."
29;293690;296240;""How are humans and Ants different?""
30;296750;299690;"When Netero decided to use his last resort,"
31;300320;304290;"could this thought have crossed his mind?"
32;304890;307880;"Now, there is no way to find out."
33;319010;322010;"The two immediately understood"
34;324750;331720;"what the distant cloud of smoke and 
resulting vibration in the air signified."
35;337530;338730;"At the same time,"
36;340280;344220;"Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye."
37;351160;353320;"After his experience with Youpi,"
38;353320;356600;"Knuckle hoped to reach a 
similar understanding with Pouf."
39;357210;362390;"But his faint hopes were quickly shattered."
40;382840;384660;"If the King waves his baton,"
41;384660;386870;"the soldiers will become demons if necessary."
42;389720;394280;"Pouf's main body must have learned 
that something happened to the King."
43;395540;399790;"That led to the transformation of the clone's 
face, revealing the Ants' true nature."
44;401110;403910;"Did the chairman defeat the King?"
45;404420;407300;"No, it doesn't matter either way..."
46;411760;417920;"In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier 
that could not be overcome."
47;425320;426610;"It's destroyed!"
48;428720;430530;"Is everyone okay?"
49;448290;449950;"This is brutal..."
50;451080;454320;"It only took them thirty minutes 
to wreck the whole place."
51;471610;473140;"That was close..."
52;474090;475200;"Ikalgo."
53;479270;480190;"Killua!"
54;493320;494460;"Palm..."
55;496930;498010;"I see."
56;498480;499910;"But I'm glad to see you."
57;500410;502480;"You returned to us."
58;503190;508040;"Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car."
59;508040;510450;"No, she wants to stay."
60;511840;515170;"Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight."
61;515500;518730;"In terms of raw offensive power, 
she has me beat..."
62;519220;520080;"Probably."
63;522550;526250;"To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once."
64;526920;527930;"However..."
65;528600;529800;"I'll wait."
66;530990;533380;"I'll respect his wishes..."
67;534240;535170;"His wishes?"
68;536690;540350;"He's decided to fight Pitou by himself."
69;542020;544870;"I'll wait right here for one hour."
70;546380;549550;"And once he's made up his mind, 
that's it. He won't budge."
71;550820;554610;"In return, he performs his best"
72;554610;557160;"when circumstances are as expected."
73;557630;562390;"Which means all we can do is stay out of his way."
74;562390;565230;"B-But what if..."
75;565230;567170;"Yeah, I know."
76;567910;573890;"If he gets into serious trouble, 
we'll immediately rush in to help him."
77;578020;579360;"I see..."
78;579670;582250;"So that's why they're staying behind."
79;584150;588290;"Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has,"
80;588800;591180;"he still won't be able to beat Pitou."
81;591860;595630;"In fact, even if the three of us join him,"
82;595630;598350;"they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou."
83;601350;603300;"They're staying behind"
84;603930;605740;"to die with him!"
85;612650;614600;"We're also looking for Knuckle and the others."
86;615090;616220;"Want to come?"
87;617030;618220;"Absolutely."
88;620590;622430;"Okay, let's go."
89;632510;634930;"We separated the King and the Royal Guard"
90;634930;637360;"to let the chairman defeat the King."
91;638300;643370;"As Knov-san said, we've completed 
the mission we were assigned."
92;644280;647370;"Each of us will have to decide 
where we go from here."
93;648090;651130;"Do we stop or keep going?"
94;660360;661510;"I am"
95;662320;664390;"going to keep fighting them."
96;665480;668390;"I've already laid down my life here more than once."
97;669490;671300;"Even if we can't reach an understanding,"
98;671750;674020;"I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome."
99;727730;728990;"You're finished."
100;737780;739810;"Why did he say that?"
101;740480;743010;"There's still time left..."
102;743710;746320;"Did he notice that my surgery was done?"
103;747890;750770;"I made sure to hide my progress from him."
104;751860;755650;"But if I showed any sign of 
relaxing after finishing it,"
105;756370;758380;"and he noticed that..."
106;760060;761990;"I must kill him."
107;763260;764910;"No matter the cost!"
108;765420;766690;"I must kill him..."
109;767920;769560;"For the King's sake!"
110;771940;773910;"Did he notice my bloodlust then?"
111;774890;775920;"Stand up."
112;795810;797770;"We move to Peijing now."
113;798160;800480;"Running is faster for us."
114;812950;815610;"What happened to me?"
115;817550;820210;"I would like to—"
116;821040;824590;"The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her."
117;827070;829350;"S-Sorry!"
118;829750;833100;"Am I interrupting something?"
119;834670;839100;"U-Um, I don't understand what's going on..."
120;843910;845000;"I understand."
121;845600;846610;"Let's go."
122;850870;855120;"Pitou was close enough to take 
off his head with one arm."
123;855960;857410;"But Pitou couldn't move."
124;858740;861790;"After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,"
125;861790;864060;"Pitou's instincts said to obey."
126;866300;867880;"I can't make a move now..."
127;868310;869450;"My chance will come."
128;869990;872210;"There'll be many, on our way to Peijing."
129;873610;877650;"But I must get Komugi to the King!"
130;889460;893330;"Gon, want me to use Chapter 7 
Bankruptcy on Pitou?"
131;894560;898390;"If there's an escape attempt, 
I can track Pitou down."
132;898390;902310;"And if Pitou tries to fight back, 
APR will protect you."
133;912820;914600;"Thank you, Knuckle."
134;915260;916740;"But it's okay."
135;918080;920350;"I trust Pitou..."
136;922280;926110;"So until Pitou and I have met with Kite,"
137;926960;928360;"keep an eye on her."
138;931350;934620;"A-Are you talking about me?"
139;950490;952680;"Is he going to use Komugi..."
140;953730;956010;"As a hostage?!"
141;959640;965520;"Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go."
142;966680;969530;"I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?"
143;971460;972450;"Pitou?"
144;994100;995550;"You sure about this, Killua?"
145;997330;999310;"You aren't going with Gon?"
146;1000300;1001280;"We were..."
147;1001730;1005120;"No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon."
148;1006060;1009070;"But Gon didn't want him to come!"
149;1012580;1015780;"Pitou and I will go by ourselves."
150;1018000;1019070;"It's okay."
151;1019380;1021260;"That was always the plan."
152;1021720;1024870;"And I feel better after hearing what he's doing."
153;1025490;1027660;"You mean the hostage?"
154;1027660;1031440;"Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along,"
155;1031440;1033650;"and Pitou managed to capture me."
156;1034090;1037240;"Then Pitou would have the option 
to exchange hostages."
157;1039350;1041000;"Seriously..."
158;1041410;1045480;"What have they been through for 
their minds to work this way?"
159;1046600;1047980;"It's all right."
160;1048470;1050690;"Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,"
161;1050690;1054360;"I'll know immediately if something happens."
162;1055240;1058490;"Besides, Pitou won't abandon her."
163;1058980;1061990;"Which means that Gon is safe."
164;1066740;1071000;"I can't understand what's going on."
165;1072170;1075990;"Where is the Supreme Leader?"
166;1075990;1078200;"Who are these people?"
167;1101430;1105310;"The heat of the explosion had 
melted the rock into magma,"
168;1105310;1109240;"leaving a scene resembling the 
mouth of an active volcano,"
169;1109690;1112330;"producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke"
170;1112330;1115300;"that prevented the living from entering."
171;1125750;1126810;"Pouf!"
172;1130670;1134410;"I'll search inside, so I need you to 
search the surrounding area."
173;1134800;1137430;"It's possible that the explosion 
sent the King flying."
174;1139620;1142490;"I was wrong..."
175;1144420;1148830;"We will kill them all, with the King at our side."
176;1150350;1152200;"None will be spared!"
177;1209950;1211640;"Your Majesty!"
178;1256810;1260940;"Youpi's roar had an ominous tone."
179;1261440;1264480;"Before he could even see the truth for himself,"
180;1265340;1268950;"tears were already streaming down Pouf's face."
181;1273390;1277800;"Your Majesty!"
182;1276020;1280210;"Your Majesty!"
183;1404850;1405500;"Next time:"
184;1405500;1408340;"Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love."
185;1408340;1411050;"I never ask for anything in return."
186;1411050;1412800;"Isn't that unconditional love?"
187;1412800;1414680;"Unparalleled joy."
