1;2370;4480;"Yeah, this looks real."
2;4930;6850;"There's a video attached."
3;6850;8110;"We have two targets."
4;8510;10110;"A man and a woman."
5;10530;13660;"I'll leave now, so let's meet there."
6;13660;14610;"Got it."
7;15180;16680;"Let's go, Killua."
8;16680;17240;"Yeah."
9;98990;104040;"Pursuit x And x Analysis"
10;106430;110230;"After a tip about the Phantom Troupe, 
Gon and his friends move out."
11;110790;113290;"There, they encounter Machi and Nobunaga."
12;113850;118250;"However, the two aren't just 
waiting around to be caught."
13;120410;123920;"Was Uvo really killed?"
14;124770;125810;"Probably."
15;127840;130920;"Uvo was more than just a dumb brute."
16;130920;133070;"I know that."
17;133430;137260;"Even if he were fighting 
a difficult opponent,"
18;137260;140200;"he had the wits and experience to prevail."
19;142350;143530;"Hello?"
20;143530;145700;"I'm the one who submitted the request."
21;145700;148150;"You're late! Where are you?"
22;148150;149720;"Stop looking around..."
23;149720;151850;"I can see you."
24;151850;154990;"It's the couple behind your boyfriend?"
25;154990;156820;"I'll wire the money to you now,"
26;156820;158090;"so please confirm receipt."
27;161210;161840;"For real?"
28;163740;164760;"Let's go!"
29;164760;165600;"Hurry!"
30;167070;169850;"But Uvo didn't return."
31;170430;173480;"Has he ever been late without informing us?"
32;174630;176610;"But remember what he said?"
33;177140;181110;"He wasn't coming back until he 
settled up with that chain user."
34;181500;183890;"That's why I said probably."
35;184370;186620;"I never said he was definitely dead."
36;187100;188030;"Just a hunch?"
37;188950;189850;"Just a hunch."
38;192130;194710;"Well, you're usually right."
39;194710;197500;"Okay, we should decide our next move."
40;197500;200030;"How do we catch those two?"
41;200470;201540;"It's impossible."
42;203410;205640;"We aren't strong enough to handle them."
43;205640;206930;"What was that?"
44;206930;208670;"We won't know until we try!"
45;208670;211330;"And why are you saying this now?!"
46;211330;213100;"Quiet... They'll notice us."
47;214100;215610;"But it's still true."
48;215610;217400;"I knew it as soon as I saw them."
49;218890;222490;"My dad once had a hit on a Troupe member."
50;223030;223550;"Huh?"
51;223550;224310;"What?"
52;224960;226780;"One of the few times I've 
ever heard him complain."
53;227400;229930;"Said the job wasn't worth the price."
54;231220;234540;"That's considered the greatest 
compliment a target can get."
55;235500;237920;"That was when he told us"
56;238410;240810;"to stay away from the Troupe."
57;242170;243880;"It's been a few years,"
58;243880;246250;"so I thought we might stand a chance..."
59;247170;250570;"They're really that strong?"
60;250570;254690;"Would it help you to picture 
two Hisokas sitting there?"
61;256830;258740;"That is definitely not"
62;258740;261190;"something we can handle."
63;261530;264320;"So, why do you think they're here?"
64;264320;266970;"Aren't they on a date?"
65;266970;268420;"Huh? Really?"
66;268420;272200;"No, they noticed that other 
couple behind them."
67;272890;276710;"They're paying close attention 
to their surroundings."
68;277070;281340;"At first, I thought it was just caution 
because the Mafia is after them."
69;281910;286090;"But in that case, they wouldn't 
be sitting in a public place."
70;286880;289850;"They aren't worried at all."
71;291930;293730;"They're waiting for someone to find them."
72;294220;297730;"Acting as bait, to draw out their prey."
73;299180;300730;"We're being watched."
74;301160;302630;"They aren't amateurs."
75;303750;306210;"Yeah, I can't tell where they are,"
76;306210;308090;"but they're focused on us."
77;308090;309370;"Is it the chain user?"
78;309910;311280;"No idea."
79;311280;315410;"If it is, we'll follow the 
boss' orders to go wild."
80;316480;320330;"I believe the boss wishes to recruit him."
81;320900;322000;"Machi..."
82;322940;327260;"The boss only told us to find 
him and bring him back."
83;327980;330890;"Have you forgotten the unspoken rule?"
84;331460;334700;"Alive or dead. 
By any means necessary."
85;334700;336270;"Right?"
86;336920;340840;"You're free to interpret the 
boss' orders as you like,"
87;340840;343370;"but you can't force me to agree."
88;343870;346240;"I haven't said anything yet."
89;346590;348910;"You're the one forcing the issue."
90;355070;357050;"The atmosphere changed."
91;357050;358990;"I've got a really bad feeling..."
92;358990;360700;"Did they notice us?"
93;360700;361720;"It's okay."
94;361720;363130;"They haven't noticed us yet."
95;363130;364630;"Are you sure?"
96;364630;369050;"Besides, I can't use <i>Zetsu</i> like 
you guys to mask my presence."
97;369430;372800;"If we used <i>Zetsu</i>, that would 
attract their attention."
98;373440;376190;"They aren't trying to sense <i>Nen</i>."
99;376750;379220;"They're trying to see if there's anyone"
100;379220;381710;"in this area who looks or acts suspicious."
101;382400;385350;"So you'd better wipe those 
looks off your faces."
102;385770;387190;"Act normal."
103;388900;391450;"Sorry, that was a bad idea."
104;392650;394570;"Let's make it clear, then."
105;395030;400100;"Are we going to take him dead, or alive?"
106;401690;402730;"Fine."
107;408220;409220;"Heads."
108;409220;410220;"Tails."
109;415490;416640;"Her?"
110;416640;419110;"Yes, she is Nostrade's daughter."
111;419110;420230;"Her name is Neon."
112;420780;422830;"According to the online Hunter information,"
113;422830;426230;"the chain user is one of her bodyguards."
114;426840;429200;"As for her other bodyguards,"
115;429200;431840;"we have pictures and names for these five."
116;432810;436550;"And this girl is responsible 
for Nostrade's success?"
117;437240;438640;"Most likely."
118;438640;440530;"This information comes 
from the Hunter website,"
119;440530;441770;"so it should be accurate."
120;446110;447000;"I see..."
121;447910;449750;"Now I understand what happened."
122;449750;452010;"It was wise to switch rooms."
123;452640;456930;"The Phantom Troupe is definitely 
using the pro Hunter website."
124;457340;460960;"If you'd moved any later, 
Neon might have been in danger."
125;460960;461960;"I'm grateful."
126;463020;465690;"Looking ahead, the first step"
127;465690;467760;"is to get my daughter home."
128;468620;470170;"Is that okay, Neon?"
129;470900;473280;"Well, I don't have a choice."
130;473770;477320;"The auction was canceled, 
so I don't have any reason to stay."
131;479120;481290;"I really wanted to go..."
132;481930;484830;"They'll hold another auction next year."
133;484830;486320;"Cheer up."
134;486320;488270;"And I promise I'll recover"
135;488270;491260;"the items you wanted from those bandits."
136;491800;492860;"Really?"
137;493220;494860;"Yes, I promise."
138;494860;498310;"Have I ever broken a promise?"
139;498310;500920;"Have you ever kept a promise?"
140;502240;504840;"You make a good point..."
141;505640;507690;"I believe your names are 
Melody and Basho?"
142;507980;509050;"Yes..."
143;509050;512190;"You'll take Neon back to 
the house immediately."
144;512720;516090;"To be on the safe side, 
use simple disguises."
145;517730;518990;"Okay, Neon."
146;518990;521120;"Return to your room and pack."
147;521390;522550;"Okay."
148;525360;527660;"All right, let's get down to our real business."
149;530120;532880;"The auction will resume tonight."
150;533910;535580;"The time and location haven't changed."
151;536040;537640;"The community must demonstrate"
152;537640;540890;"that they will not allow anyone 
to intimidate them."
153;541410;545520;"The Ten Dons have vowed to 
recover the stolen merchandise."
154;545520;547020;"The stolen merchandise?"
155;547450;549350;"As I told you earlier,"
156;549350;551820;"the man we captured claimed"
157;551820;555940;"that a Shadow Beast had taken 
everything before they arrived."
158;556590;558340;"Yes, that's correct."
159;560530;563040;"The Shadow Beasts appear to be wiped out."
160;564000;566270;"Nine bodies have been recovered so far."
161;567170;570480;"The final member, Owl, was the one"
162;570480;572170;"carrying the merchandise."
163;572660;575090;"He was probably captured by the Troupe."
164;575830;579290;"The Ten Dons understand how 
frightening <i>Nen</i> can be."
165;579830;582140;"If the Troupe has someone who can 
use <i>Nen</i> to compel confession,"
166;582140;584680;"they wouldn't even need torture."
167;585460;587630;"It's believed that the merchandise Owl took"
168;587630;589770;"has fallen into the Troupe's hands."
169;591180;593460;"So, as I was saying,"
170;593460;596270;"with the Shadow Beasts 
destroyed, the Ten Dons"
171;596270;598570;"are hiring professionals to handle the Troupe."
172;598570;599820;"Professionals?"
173;602140;604130;"To the Mafia,"
174;604130;608250;"murder is a tool, not our trade."
175;609020;610970;"Considering our opponents,"
176;610970;614260;"it would be better to leave it to the experts."
177;615280;616220;"We'll have them"
178;616220;620630;"crush the Troupe for us, 
while avoiding further losses."
179;622580;626430;"However, it's also a chance to make a 
name for ourselves in the community."
180;626430;629370;"We cannot allow those hit men all the glory."
181;630490;631980;"So, Kurapika..."
182;632500;635110;"I want you to join those hit men."
183;643460;645740;"Take care of the chain user for me."
184;646770;648220;"Got it."
185;652610;655190;"They're on the move. 
What should we do?"
186;655190;658380;"As I told you, we can't 
beat them in a fight."
187;658380;659890;"We'll find a way..."
188;660400;662140;"We have to."
189;662140;663190;"Yeah."
190;663190;665510;"We can't leave empty-handed."
191;666810;667770;"Okay."
192;668060;670550;"Then listen carefully."
193;671110;672910;"Gon and I will tail them."
194;672910;676030;"We absolutely cannot let them spot us."
195;676320;677280;"We'll use <i>Zetsu</i>."
196;680030;681160;"Wow..."
197;681160;684280;"I can see him standing here, 
but I can't sense him."
198;685180;687410;"Gon, I need you to make me two promises."
199;687930;692670;"If they see us, we give up 
immediately and escape."
200;693210;697050;"If I judge that further pursuit is impossible 
for any other reason, we give up."
201;697050;697970;"Got it?"
202;697970;699360;"Uh-huh."
203;699360;701220;"The signal to stop will be one phone call."
204;701730;703600;"Make sure your phone's on vibrate."
205;703600;706460;"If they split up, we follow the woman."
206;707050;707720;"Leorio,"
207;707920;711170;"contact Zepile, and keep an 
eye on the auction for us."
208;711170;712530;"Got it."
209;712530;714980;"I'm guessing you've never 
tailed anyone before?"
210;714980;716150;"Um..."
211;716150;717480;"Well..."
212;717480;719770;"During the Hunter Exam, I trailed Hisoka."
213;719770;721530;"Really? Without his noticing?"
214;721530;724240;"Yeah, I was on his tail for a whole day."
215;726000;728080;"Wow, not bad."
216;728660;730800;"Ow... Why did you hit me?"
217;730800;732360;"Uh, it seemed appropriate."
218;733120;735950;"Well, then you should have no problem."
219;735950;738920;"Be sure to stay out of 
their field of vision."
220;739360;740560;"Okay, let's go."
221;740560;741310;"Yeah!"
222;747390;751070;"The targets have passed the plaza 
and entered a side street."
223;751430;753100;"Okay, confirmed."
224;753100;754650;"Do they know we're here?"
225;755200;756450;"It's okay."
226;756450;759360;"We're using <i>Zetsu</i>, so they shouldn't notice 
us unless something's really wrong."
227;759660;763420;"But they're on constant guard 
against pursuers, so stay vigilant."
228;763420;764420;"Yeah."
229;764420;765860;"You, too."
230;767120;770100;"Tsk, he's telling me to be careful?"
231;770100;774150;"I'm the one who has to be alert to 
any change in their movements."
232;777630;778710;"It's okay."
233;778710;779840;"They haven't noticed us."
234;780460;784130;"When they realize we're here, 
they'll react in some way."
235;784900;786340;"They can try to conceal it,"
236;786340;789530;"but their faces or behavior will betray it."
237;791470;796150;"I've been put through life-or-death 
shadowing exercises since I was three."
238;796630;799980;"I won't fail and lose sight of them!"
239;802040;803150;"Are we being followed?"
240;803810;806990;"Most likely, I'd guess."
241;807800;809480;"I'm impressed."
242;810140;811490;"I can't sense a thing."
243;812380;814250;"They must be quite skilled."
244;829590;833060;"Crap, they're moving toward a deserted area."
245;834320;837020;"They must realize by now that 
they're being followed."
246;837830;840530;"Then is this a trap?"
247;840530;843480;"No, they don't know our exact locations."
248;843920;848210;"Or maybe they don't know they're being 
followed and are heading back to base."
249;848860;851000;"That would make this a huge success."
250;851750;852650;"Is this a trap?"
251;853170;854040;"Or their hideout?"
252;854790;855790;"Which is it?"
253;856990;858750;"If it's a trap, we should run immediately."
254;858750;860440;"If it's their hideout, we should continue."
255;864870;867050;"They're acting calm..."
256;867800;869050;"We continue!"
257;875420;877230;"Our stalker isn't taking the bait."
258;877730;880560;"It probably isn't the chain user."
259;880560;881640;"Why not?"
260;882000;884740;"I can sense multiple people tailing us."
261;885430;888580;"But the chain user works alone."
262;888580;889570;"How can you be sure?"
263;890210;893300;"He's a member of the 
Nostrade Family, right?"
264;893810;898030;"Yet he managed to defeat Uvo on his own."
265;898680;902330;"I'm sure because the Mafia 
hasn't taken any action."
266;902880;905770;"If the Mafia were responsible,"
267;905770;909290;"they would use Uvo as a chip 
against us, dead or alive."
268;909840;913850;"Had they killed him, the news would 
probably be on the Net by now."
269;914600;916110;"Since there's nothing,"
270;916110;918530;"the chain user probably defeated Uvo alone,"
271;918530;921080;"without reporting it to the Mafia."
272;921620;926860;"Why would someone who works 
for the Mafia operate solo?"
273;928360;930470;"It was probably a personal grudge."
274;930470;933250;"You're using "probably" a lot."
275;933250;934340;"Shut up."
276;934820;938310;"I doubt that someone seeking 
revenge without Mafia backup"
277;938310;940870;"would team up with anyone else."
278;941380;944090;"Thus, the chain user is operating alone"
279;944090;946970;"and unrelated to the group now pursuing us."
280;946970;949830;"Your theory has a lot of holes."
281;949830;952260;"Then what do you think?"
282;954070;955340;"Indeed..."
283;956000;959740;"I suspect that there's a link between 
this tail and the chain user."
284;961020;962390;"You just know?"
285;962620;963620;"I just know."
286;964140;965770;"Man..."
287;965770;970150;"People who act on instinct 
shouldn't criticize theories."
288;970150;972000;"Well, Killua?"
289;972000;974780;"They're waiting for someone 
or trying to lure us out."
290;974780;976040;"One or the other."
291;976040;978410;"Do they know we're following them?"
292;978410;980220;"Right now, it's fifty-fifty."
293;980220;982050;"But they don't know our location."
294;982050;985170;"They want to draw us out because 
they don't know where we are."
295;985740;987670;"They're inviting us to show ourselves."
296;987670;988570;"What do we do?"
297;989050;990880;"They may be waiting for someone else."
298;990880;992250;"Hold your position and wait."
299;994650;996180;"Gon, I'm hanging up."
300;996660;998100;"Pay close attention."
301;998100;1002180;"If they give any kind of reaction, 
we'll run for it!"
302;1002700;1005170;"Escape as soon as I ring the phone."
303;1005170;1006030;"Got it?"
304;1006030;1007940;"Yeah, got it."
305;1008630;1009710;"Phinks here."
306;1009710;1011450;"Oh, what's up?"
307;1011450;1013240;"I wanted to see how you were doing."
308;1013940;1017910;"We're being followed, 
but they haven't made a move."
309;1017910;1020940;"And we can't locate them, 
so this will take a while."
310;1021740;1024620;"Oh, then would you like some helpful info?"
311;1024620;1026460;"Hmm? What do you mean?"
312;1067250;1068750;"The stones were a distraction?"
313;1068750;1069500;"This'll get him!"
314;1071250;1072780;"He stopped me with ease..."
315;1072780;1074260;"With one hand!"
316;1085260;1086210;"Yo."
317;1087490;1090980;"Phinks, why are you here?"
318;1091720;1094490;"Weren't you heading out with the boss?"
319;1094930;1096490;"This is the fourth floor."
320;1096490;1100240;"To fool the enemy, 
you first fool your allies."
321;1101740;1103840;"The boss got me good again."
322;1104390;1108000;"I wondered why there were so 
many <i>Zetsu</i> masters around."
323;1108590;1109890;"Stalking the stalkers?"
324;1109890;1112270;"Mustache-guy and the woman didn't know?"
325;1112270;1113250;"They fooled us!"
326;1113830;1115220;"Okay, kid."
327;1115730;1118030;"I have a few questions for you."
328;1122780;1126020;"Boy, do you know the chain user?"
329;1126020;1126790;"Huh?"
330;1127640;1130500;"A <i>Nen</i> user who uses chains to fight."
331;1130500;1132190;"We're looking for him."
332;1133120;1136690;"He asked you to follow us, right?"
333;1137300;1138440;"I don't know who that is."
334;1138830;1142160;"We were following you 
for our own reasons."
335;1142730;1144270;"I just need one moment..."
336;1144270;1146410;"With an opening, I can escape!"
337;1147610;1148410;"Well?"
338;1149450;1151270;"Well, indeed..."
339;1151270;1153420;"If he's lying, he's really good."
340;1154550;1155830;"I can check."
341;1156760;1159750;"Question 1... 
Why were you following us?"
342;1159750;1161550;"Answer concisely."
343;1163790;1165650;"Lying will only make the situation worse."
344;1166530;1170440;"The Mafia has put a huge 
bounty on your heads."
345;1170970;1175450;"Websites are offering a lot of money 
just for information on your location."
346;1176080;1179190;"Question 2... 
Who taught you to shadow people?"
347;1179630;1181360;"Well, mainly,"
348;1181360;1185060;"I was using <i>Zetsu</i>, a <i>Nen</i> ability, 
to conceal my presence."
349;1185660;1188120;"I'm trying to become a pro Hunter."
350;1188120;1190000;"Who taught you how to do that?"
351;1191000;1192870;"A Shingen-ryu master."
352;1193220;1194250;"Question 3..."
353;1194250;1197500;"Do you know a <i>Nen</i> user 
who fights with chains?"
354;1198010;1199340;"Chains?"
355;1199340;1202050;"He would be a Conjurer or Manipulator."
356;1202450;1206960;"Does your master have chains 
hanging from his right arm?"
357;1206960;1210770;"Or perhaps it's you?"
358;1211190;1212290;"I don't know."
359;1212710;1214550;"My master is an Enhancer,"
360;1214960;1218280;"and he only taught me the 
four major principles."
361;1218870;1222380;"I see... Well, nothing we 
can do, if you don't know."
362;1222380;1224740;"Time for the last question, then."
363;1224740;1226550;"You have two choices."
364;1226550;1228540;"Consider carefully before you answer."
365;1229850;1232210;"Do you want to die now or later?"
366;1232670;1234290;"Make your choice."
367;1234290;1236540;"You have three seconds to answer."
368;1244110;1246800;"It's useless. 
Don't try anything foolish."
369;1246800;1248050;"Yes..."
370;1248050;1249820;"Understood, we'll head over."
371;1250730;1254170;"Boy, your friend surrendered."
372;1257550;1259190;"I'll ask you once more."
373;1259190;1260820;"Do you know the chain user?"
374;1260820;1262810;"My answer is the same."
375;1262810;1263750;"I don't."
376;1263750;1264690;"I see."
377;1265450;1267300;"How about you?"
378;1267300;1268830;"Any guesses?"
379;1291780;1293350;"Welcome to our base."
380;1299190;1302860;"They stand inside the 
Phantom Troupe's hideout..."
381;1304140;1308590;"...nerves mounting to their limits."
382;1381110;1386150;"Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit"
383;1381110;1386490;"Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia"
384;1381400;1382950;"Coming up, we have Gon"
385;1382950;1383650;"and Killua's"
386;1383650;1385300;"Hunterpedia!"
387;1386630;1387530;"It's Gon"
388;1387530;1388360;"and Killua's"
389;1388360;1389610;"Hunterpedia!"
390;1388650;1400000;"Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia"
391;1389610;1391170;"Today, we introduce Machi."
392;1391010;1392700;"A Phantom Troupe member."
393;1391170;1392270;"A Phantom Troupe member."
394;1392270;1393620;"She's a Transmuter."
395;1392700;1400000;"Transmutes aura into <i>Nen</i> 
threads that she controls."
396;1393620;1395760;"She can turn her aura into <i>Nen</i> threads."
397;1395760;1397460;"Her special technique is Nen Stitches."
398;1397460;1399310;"She can put your body back together!"
399;1399310;1400210;"Like this!"
400;1404840;1406840;"Next time: Ally x And x Sword."
401;1406840;1407630;"Snatch!"
402;1408490;1409140;"Bam!"
403;1409140;1410970;"Look! I caught it!"
404;1410970;1412970;"That's one of Milluki's miniature bombs!"
405;1412970;1414480;"Ka-boom!"
