1;7720;9480;"What do we do, Zaikahal?"
2;96990;102030;"Evil x and x Terrible"
3;107360;109240;"His name is Gyro."
4;109240;112040;"And he is the NGL's don in the shadows."
5;115600;119150;"Gyro spent his first twelve years"
6;119150;121300;"in a construction camp."
7;122220;123950;"By the time he said his first word,"
8;123950;128800;"he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete."
9;129480;134020;"His father forced him to slave away..."
10;134020;136420;"until Gyro finally killed him and fled."
11;139990;144330;"His father, who raised Gyro 
alone, was a silent man."
12;146450;149010;"When his father returned from work,"
13;149010;151580;"he drank cheap liquor by himself 
until he went to bed."
14;152080;157740;"He very rarely talked to Gyro, 
who was on the upper bunk."
15;159190;161320;"Thus, Gyro barely knew"
16;161320;165170;"how to speak before the age of seven."
17;167360;170280;"When Gyro returned from work,"
18;170280;172780;"he was not permitted to leave his bed,"
19;172780;175700;"except when visiting the restroom."
20;176650;181810;"He was allowed to relieve himself twice 
a day, and only before 9 PM."
21;183060;188430;"The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly 
whenever he turned in his sleep."
22;188880;191420;"His father hated that sound."
23;194350;199540;"After his father once severely 
beat him because of that noise,"
24;200110;204090;"Gyro learned to sleep without any motion."
25;205600;210720;"He also learned to control his bladder at night,"
26;210720;215110;"keeping an empty liquor bottle 
for when he couldn't hold it."
27;216920;219800;""Don't make trouble for others.""
28;220630;226620;"That was the one lesson his 
silent father taught him."
29;227870;232430;"From a young age, Gyro did 
his best to adhere to it,"
30;232430;235240;"learning from his mistakes."
31;236400;240040;"Since his father had never 
bought him even one toy,"
32;240650;245140;"this lesson was his one and 
only gift from his father."
33;246360;251750;"Within his small world, 
his father was essentially God."
34;252380;256190;"And no matter how cruel his father could be,"
35;256700;259420;"Gyro continued to idolize him,"
36;259420;263300;"believing that his father needed him."
37;263930;266160;"This belief stemmed from two facts..."
38;267230;269660;"When Gyro was five,"
39;269660;272250;"a terrible fever nearly killed him."
40;272900;277610;"All night, his father stayed up, 
replacing his towels with fresh ones."
41;280080;281670;"And the other reason was..."
42;282670;288280;"that his father had never 
once ordered him to leave."
43;289540;293500;"Gyro was proud of these two facts."
44;294690;296540;""Idiot..."
45;296540;300940;"He hasn't kicked you out 
because you bring in money!""
46;302150;306730;"Though he had previously kept that 
possibility locked away deep in his mind,"
47;307330;312790;"Gyro snapped when the older youth 
insensitively brought it to light."
48;313520;319570;"Regretting that he'd revealed his secret, 
Gyro was furious with himself."
49;320240;325800;"His pride wounded, rage overcame 
him, and he attacked the youth."
50;327210;330830;"The youth had always mocked the timid boy,"
51;330830;334520;"so when the boy fought back, 
he went mad with anger,"
52;334520;339270;"to the point where not even 
knocking him out would satisfy him."
53;340320;343280;"He stomped on the boy's face,"
54;343610;347280;"spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:"
55;347650;352530;""When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!"
56;352930;357410;"Your old man was drinking by himself as always."
57;359300;362370;"You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this."
58;363100;366960;"But that night, the neighbor had 
a fight with your old man."
59;367580;371000;"He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died."
60;371670;375830;"Let me tell you what your old man said."
61;376880;378300;"It wouldn't matter."
62;378300;380810;"I don't care if he dies."
63;381220;382480;"You hear that?""
64;384280;386670;"As Gyro listened to the youth,"
65;387320;389820;"he witnessed something inconceivable."
66;399400;402900;"His father looked him in the eye,"
67;402900;407370;"paid him no attention, and then left."
68;408810;412180;"That was when Gyro finally understood."
69;414970;418410;"The universe doesn't give a damn about me."
70;419670;424820;"My father doesn't care if I live or die."
71;424820;427850;"In other words, my life has no meaning."
72;429860;432380;"If I live, I'll bring in money."
73;432380;436870;"If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all."
74;437440;443880;"My father told me not to 
make trouble for others"
75;443880;447910;"so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself."
76;448350;452090;"It was never a lesson to help his son."
77;452090;455080;"It was fully for his own benefit."
78;456290;459500;"In that lesson, "others" meant my father."
79;459500;460400;"No..."
80;461490;464280;"It meant "humans.""
81;468880;471400;"Don't make trouble for humans."
82;473540;476390;"I must not be human..."
83;479000;481800;"Eventually, the boy stood up,"
84;481800;485050;"grabbing a nearby hammer."
85;493300;497020;"Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL."
86;497500;502670;"Nine years after that, NGL became 
a nation, with him as its king."
87;504840;509020;"Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world."
88;509740;516020;"The drug D² was merely the first step."
89;528870;529930;"Yunju!"
90;530620;534220;"You handed those humans over to Colt so easily."
91;535600;537300;"I didn't feel like fighting."
92;537860;540470;"Either way, the food will reach the Queen."
93;541190;543560;"I just want to enjoy the hunt."
94;546460;547560;"Gyro..."
95;548400;551650;"Damn, I should have just eaten him!"
96;553070;554200;"Listen up!"
97;554200;556070;"I'm taking over this factory!"
98;556700;559310;"From today on, this is my fortress!"
99;576910;579260;"This is awesome!"
100;595890;597040;"This is bad."
101;597040;599710;"These creatures are too dangerous!"
102;600030;600770;"Look!"
103;610320;611560;"What..."
104;615090;619180;"What is happening in this place?"
105;632390;635110;"What? More dead soldiers found?"
106;635490;638860;"Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered."
107;639410;642370;"Plus, one of mine is missing..."
108;642370;645400;"Its communication has been cut 
off, and it hasn't returned."
109;646200;649610;"Yunju's team dealt with the 
humans holding guns."
110;649610;654040;"Does this mean there are other 
humans who are resisting us?"
111;654380;656580;"Sounds that way..."
112;657050;661890;"But the dead soldiers were killed 
by something that wasn't a gun."
113;662240;663210;"Something?"
114;663710;665390;"What could it have been?"
115;665860;667580;"How would I know?"
116;667580;670390;"Probably some new weapon we haven't seen."
117;673410;675190;"Where are the corpses?"
118;675190;677400;"Peggy's examining them above."
119;677940;680400;"This one was killed by a gun."
120;680400;684160;"I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body."
121;684630;686910;"But I'm not sure about the others."
122;688080;690430;"The skull was punctured."
123;690430;692920;"Yes, but not by a gun."
124;693180;695640;"And I had difficulty understanding"
125;695640;697940;"the soldiers' explanation of the events..."
126;698410;702430;"As it is, the foot soldiers' communications 
are simplistic and just to the point."
127;702960;707550;"They said one human mimicked firing 
a gun, and no projectile emerged,"
128;707550;710930;"but something pierced the 
soldier's skulls and they fell, dead."
129;711290;715780;"Can't some soldiers both see 
and feel what's happening?"
130;715780;717380;"You're correct."
131;717380;722200;"Those soldiers said that they 
felt a projectile being fired."
132;724710;727650;"So they possess abilities that we do not..."
133;728170;731080;"These humans could prove tougher 
opponents than anticipated."
134;732050;736840;"If humans have this power, once we 
inherit their genes, we also will."
135;737190;738550;"We only lack the trait."
136;739840;741840;"You don't understand..."
137;741840;745340;"The humans' strength lies
in their ability to learn."
138;745750;748840;"If they learn that the Queen 
is where we're vulnerable,"
139;748840;752750;"they'll do whatever it takes to kill her."
140;753160;753850;"Hmm?"
141;754540;756570;"You're the one who doesn't understand!"
142;757130;762110;"That just means we need to do 
whatever it takes to keep her safe."
143;762650;763860;"Am I wrong?"
144;766310;768870;"No, you're correct..."
145;771490;772620;"That's right."
146;773210;774730;"I will protect her..."
147;775950;777630;"I will protect Reina!"
148;778010;778880;"Reina?"
149;781230;782840;"Who's Reina?"
150;782840;785520;"Uh, you're the one who said that name!"
151;785520;786390;"I did?"
152;786840;788780;"I didn't say anything."
153;788780;790430;"You must be hearing things."
154;791430;793140;"Anyway,"
155;793140;796960;"the problem is that humans 
possess multiple weapons"
156;796960;799180;"capable of defeating our foot soldiers."
157;801070;802150;"What should we do?"
158;802830;804400;"Use their weapons against them."
159;805210;809160;"Give them a taste of their own medicine."
160;809630;813160;"Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity 
to manipulate complex weaponry."
161;813780;816990;"But the humans don't know that."
162;817430;819600;"They must be very frightened."
163;820070;821170;"I understand..."
164;823600;827680;"You're a better strategist than I am."
165;832890;834100;"Reina?"
166;841090;842150;"It didn't work..."
167;842510;844650;"No one received the message."
168;845220;848910;"That means all the other Hunters I was 
in contact with have been taken out."
169;849410;850690;"Oh..."
170;851710;852910;"We should leave."
171;854260;857410;"Those creatures are too much for us to handle."
172;857800;861670;"We need to leave NGL and tell 
the world what's happening..."
173;862350;864220;"So that an extermination force can be formed."
174;864220;867180;"Whatever... Let's just run for it!"
175;868330;869430;"Or we'll all be—"
176;885780;888320;"I-It's here!"
177;897260;898250;"Run!"
178;898250;899930;"More will be coming!"
179;899930;901230;"Hold on, now..."
180;902040;905800;"I said to capture the humans alive."
181;906290;909510;"We're supposed to deliver 
them to the Queen fresh."
182;909830;911500;"A-A human face..."
183;911500;913010;"What is that thing?!"
184;913330;914150;"Fire..."
185;914150;915760;"Open fire!"
186;916580;918770;"{\fad(211,185)}Orange Arrow"
187;923290;925020;"He grabbed my Orange Arrow,"
188;925020;927860;"fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease."
189;929790;933260;"Huh? This is clearly visible."
190;933260;937370;"The grunts couldn't see this?"
191;937940;940390;"So the life energy"
192;940390;945630;"that surrounds your body is 
what fuels this weapon?"
193;946140;951130;"You will make a magnificent 
meal for the Queen..."
194;962310;964690;"Balda!"
195;974860;978340;"O-Oh, no!"
196;978340;981960;"I took a bite without thinking..."
197;983090;986840;"Zazan-sama will be angry again!"
198;987250;988550;"You bastard!"
199;993270;995390;"O-One moment..."
200;995390;997600;"My hands are full."
201;1002560;1004270;"Take this!"
202;1011770;1015090;"As always, you're a disgrace in battle."
203;1015090;1016280;"Zazan-sama..."
204;1016830;1019450;"Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?"
205;1019790;1020870;"Oh!"
206;1020870;1022130;"You're right."
207;1022500;1023800;"We're going back."
208;1023800;1024460;"Hmm?"
209;1024880;1027960;"Since we've obtained some excellent food."
210;1028720;1033680;"He probably has the nutritional value 
of a thousand normal humans."
211;1035060;1037090;"Well done, Pike."
212;1042730;1043850;"Zazan-sama!"
213;1043850;1046000;"I am most grateful for your praise..."
214;1046000;1048470;"You honor me!"
215;1048470;1049890;"Don't forget the food."
216;1050740;1051990;"Oh, yes..."
217;1056650;1058400;"I can't save him myself..."
218;1058400;1059720;"I have to call for help!"
219;1064230;1066350;"There's still... There's still time!"
220;1066350;1069910;"Even if they take him, they 
won't eat him immediately..."
221;1081300;1082180;"Please..."
222;1082750;1086040;"Find a Hunter with a strong aura!"
223;1092700;1094940;"I must hurry back to the border!"
224;1095650;1097070;"Other Hunters should be there—"
225;1125450;1127100;"So much fun..."
226;1135970;1138560;"Hunting is so much fun!"
227;1142740;1144740;"Help!!"
228;1144740;1150750;"Help!!

Chimera Ant Nest"
229;1146750;1150750;"Rocky Area"
230;1148750;1150750;"Notify the Hunter Association!!"
231;1164220;1165710;"It'll be dangerous."
232;1167860;1169520;"But could you accompany me?"
233;1169520;1170610;"Of course."
234;1171070;1172620;"We're pros."
235;1176230;1177150;"Miss interpreter..."
236;1177550;1179690;"Sorry, but we're in a hurry."
237;1180300;1181370;"Yes."
238;1181370;1184830;"The horses can move a bit faster."
239;1185590;1187520;"They won't be fast enough."
240;1188680;1192670;"I want you two to return to 
the border, find the others,"
241;1192670;1194670;"and get word to the Association."
242;1194670;1196620;"These creatures are dangerous."
243;1196620;1197720;"Got it."
244;1197720;1199670;"Be careful, Kite."
245;1199970;1200770;"Right."
246;1202210;1204180;"If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind."
247;1204590;1206440;"Right back at you."
248;1206440;1208180;"All ready to go!"
249;1216710;1217730;"Let's go."
250;1249610;1252100;"This is a bullet casing."
251;1252700;1255860;"Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?"
252;1256940;1259770;"So the underground rulers of NGL"
253;1260300;1263260;"were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs."
254;1263830;1266810;"But judging by this..."
255;1266810;1268370;"It wasn't done by a human."
256;1270270;1272800;"Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant."
257;1275190;1279630;"If the Chimera Ants are using guns..."
258;1282100;1283790;"I hate to consider the possibility,"
259;1284290;1286500;"but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers"
260;1286500;1289170;"have already been fed to the queen..."
261;1291340;1296060;"What will happen if Chimera Ants 
are born with their genes?"
262;1298990;1301490;"NGL and Chimera Ants..."
263;1301890;1304920;"The worst combination imaginable."
264;1306300;1309170;"This could create an unprecedented biohazard."
265;1312490;1317840;"The situation has taken a sudden 
turn for the absolute worst."
266;1406760;1409260;"Next time: The x Fight x Begins."
267;1409260;1410620;"Ready..."
268;1410620;1411510;"Set..."
269;1411510;1412550;"Gon!"
