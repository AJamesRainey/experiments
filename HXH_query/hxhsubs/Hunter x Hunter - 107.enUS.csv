in the water, right?"

30;262110;265760;"My harpoon can match the speed of sound,"

38;295260;296690;"How did you do it?"
39;298180;300690;"I simply exhaled."
40;301840;306150;"When it comes to lung capacity, 
no one in the world beats me."
41;307550;312700;"He used his breath as jet propulsion 
to break out of the whirlpool?"
42;314230;317460;"Okay, it's my turn now!"
43;318040;320440;"It's your turn?"

45;325330;328090;"All you get to do is drown in my waves!"
46;328450;332090;"During this exchange, I've learned three things."
47;334420;336320;"First, I now know your power."
48;336960;340740;"Somehow, you're able to use 
other people's abilities."
49;341410;342980;"And those earphones"
50;344020;346850;"have nothing to do with your power."
51;346850;349210;"They're either for show or for luck."
52;350280;353210;"Or it means someone is sending you orders."
53;355910;360950;"If he meant to impair his hearing 
to strengthen his power,"
54;361300;364050;"he shouldn't be able to hear me talk."
55;366200;367760;"What's the third thing?"
56;367970;370000;"Your lifespan."
57;370000;373760;"That Inamura ability belongs 
to a Hunter named Grachan."
58;375250;378870;"You probably encountered and defeated 
him when he was sent"
59;378870;380250;"to fight the Chimera Ants."
60;380600;384530;"I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!"
61;385380;388280;"Your life ends today!"
62;389070;390340;"Hold on..."
63;390340;392540;"That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation."
64;392900;396450;"I was protecting myself from humans 
who were hunting me down."
65;396450;398790;"It was self-defense."
66;399240;402780;"And I didn't steal his ability."
67;403660;405550;"I'm just borrowing it for a bit."
68;406270;409020;"Just borrowing it for a bit?"
69;409790;413280;"That's an excuse thieves use."
70;415460;419310;"Well, arguing with you is pointless."
71;419830;422430;"I'd like to get my hands on his ability,"
72;422430;425070;"but defeating him is more important."
73;425650;430860;"Right now, our top priority 
is to defeat one another."
74;432490;433830;"I'll repeat myself..."
75;434390;437400;"I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!"

77;439660;441710;"Giant Wave
<font size="20">Big Wall</font>"
78;446720;449150;"I'm flooding this underground church."
79;449150;451680;"My wall of water's gonna suck you in!"
80;451680;454180;"Just try and find your way to the surface!"
81;464390;467280;"Now, will he make it up?"
82;467710;469930;"Will I smash his skull with my board?"
83;469930;472010;"Launch my harpoon through his gut?"
84;472010;473360;"Which do I choose?"
85;474040;475500;"Either way,"
86;475500;479780;"if he shows his face above water, he's done."
87;485260;487330;"He isn't coming back up..."
88;488550;491190;"Has he drowned?"
89;491190;492010;"No,"
90;492770;495690;"he was confident about his lung capacity."
91;496390;499340;"That means he can survive for 
ten or twenty minutes."
92;500000;501540;"No, wait."
93;501540;502880;"It's just possible"
94;502880;506150;"that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!"
95;519480;520650;"There you are!"
96;521250;522950;"Don't move!"
97;522950;525170;"I'll impale you with my harpoon."
98;527160;529090;"Bubbles on the opposite side, too?"
99;531330;532490;"And over here!"
100;533990;534920;"And over there!"
101;536280;538830;"There are air bubbles everywhere..."
102;539390;540430;"I see..."
103;541640;547060;"It's possible, if he formed his smoke 
into a hose with multiple branches."
104;547060;549940;"That way, he wouldn't give away his position."
105;550180;553460;"Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?"
106;553460;557200;"Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?"
107;558200;559760;"No, that isn't it!"
108;560870;562890;"The bubbles are camouflage!"
109;563500;564580;"Is he running?"
110;565790;569480;"If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible"
111;569480;573710;"he could swim out through the maze of 
underground corridors leading down here."
112;575200;577470;"I can't let him escape!"
113;578060;583060;"I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this, 
so I could take all the credit..."
114;587070;588410;"My head's spinning?"
115;588890;590880;"And my chest hurts..."
116;591320;593730;"Have I been poisoned?"
117;600600;602280;"My board disappeared?"
118;602280;605270;"Is it because my physical and 
mental stability are compromised?"
119;607730;608920;"Can't move..."
120;609310;610410;"Can't breathe..."
121;611140;615220;"My power stopped working, 
but the water hasn't gone away?"
122;615630;617930;"Because we're underground?"
123;618340;620090;"Crap..."
124;621900;626240;"I let him think he had the advantage 
so I could turn the tables on him."
125;626240;630270;"But it looks as though the one 
who was backed into a corner..."
126;630940;632800;"was me..."
127;642010;643610;"Am I gonna die?"
128;644410;648750;"Am I... Am I gonna die here?"
129;655640;658510;"So he was using smoke hoses"
130;658510;661180;"to send air bubbles everywhere."
131;661900;664290;"But what kind of..."
132;664290;666490;"poison did he use?"
133;668460;671020;"That was faster than I expected."
134;671630;673950;"The poison you've inhaled is lethal."
135;673950;676530;"But it's something naturally found in air."
136;678110;680330;"Carbon dioxide."
137;679220;681270;"{\fad(625,1)}Carbon Dioxide"
138;682340;684830;"Morel used his immense lung capacity"
139;685290;688330;"to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church,"
140;688330;692330;"and exhaled it with an increased 
concentration of carbon dioxide."
141;695460;697710;"I started my attack"
142;697710;700920;"before you ever began."
143;702220;704530;"If he was telling the truth,"
144;704530;707850;"Grachan should be getting his ability back."
145;732790;735360;"I have a few hours in which to move around."
146;735830;739590;"During that time, I must see 
them with my own eyes!"
147;743370;746640;"I've observed Bizeff's movements 
with my crystal ball."
148;747010;749470;"I know how to leave this area."
149;752970;755040;"Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped,"
150;755580;760450;"he can't tell anyone because 
he's kept this area a secret."
151;773800;775250;"They are..."
152;776770;778400;"up above."
153;830130;832450;"I can't go any farther."
154;834010;835560;"But..."
155;875870;878600;"Oh? How are you feeling?"
156;884730;886680;"Octopus! Where am I?"
157;886680;888180;"How long was I out?"
158;888180;889610;"Don't call me an octopus!"
159;893640;896930;"This is an underground clinic for folks 
with roots in the underworld."
160;897460;900670;"You were out for two whole days."
161;901240;903000;"Two days?! I need to get going!"
162;903000;903630;"Hey!"
163;904070;905380;"You shouldn't move around!"
164;905380;906880;"Your wounds will reopen."
165;908450;910290;"I have to follow through with the plan..."
166;910290;910880;"Fool!"
167;911370;915230;"You were just on the verge of death!"
168;915620;916840;"You need a few days before—"
169;916840;918890;"Oh, you're awake?"
170;919820;921520;"That's great."
171;921750;923420;"Thanks for everything you've done."
172;923420;925000;"I'm checking out now."
173;925360;927030;"Not until you pay me."
174;927790;931530;"Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny."
175;931530;934780;"If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead."
176;935670;938910;"I don't have my wallet on me. 
I'll wire it to you when I get back."
177;939500;942830;"I'm not stupid enough to trust 
that you'll keep that promise."
178;943220;947460;"Until you find someone to bring 
the money, you're staying here."
179;947860;949880;"I don't have time for that!"
180;949880;951130;"Give me a phone!"
181;953770;956230;"It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute."
182;956230;958870;"Would you just shut up and go away?"
183;958870;959990;"Hello?"
184;959990;961050;"Hey, it's me."
185;961050;962690;"Killua!"
186;963120;965090;"Where are you? Are you okay?"
187;965090;966310;"What happened?"
188;966650;968320;"I'll explain when I see you."
189;969060;971310;"A strong enemy gave me some trouble."
190;971310;972900;"I've been in the hospital."
191;973380;974540;"Oh..."
192;974950;975950;"Well, I'm glad you called."
193;976410;978250;"This means you're okay now, right?"
194;978250;980580;"Yeah, I'll be back soon."
195;980580;981960;"Anything happen on your side?"
196;982240;985430;"We've found a strong ally."
197;985800;987960;"He's bonding with Knuckle."
198;988520;991960;"We have a plan that could 
defeat the King if it goes well."
199;992400;993460;"Oh..."
200;993460;995970;"We should meet, so I can hear what you think."
201;996550;997450;"Okay."
202;997860;1001420;"Then, I need you to send money 
to a certain bank account."
203;1001730;1004380;"If you do that, we can rendezvous today."
204;1007360;1009360;"That just leaves Palm."
205;1009360;1011700;"You haven't been able to reach her?"
206;1011700;1012330;"No."
207;1012820;1015110;"She's probably still in the palace..."
208;1015680;1020120;"But wouldn't that mean Neferpitou's 
<i>Nen</i> has already exposed her?"
209;1020390;1023380;"I imagine she's in the warehouse, 
beneath the palace."
210;1023840;1027550;"There are about five kilometers 
of corridors surrounding it."
211;1027890;1029530;"Pitou's <i>En</i> can't reach that far."
212;1029980;1035820;"But since the exit is in the 
palace, she can't get out."
213;1038270;1040080;"How's Knov-san doing?"
214;1040580;1041640;"Well..."
215;1042400;1044340;"he's probably out of this fight."
216;1049510;1052650;"But he did manage to place the exits."
217;1053120;1055500;"There's no change to our plan."
218;1058000;1059520;"Three days to go..."
219;1066920;1071400;"His wounds are already healed!"
220;1080340;1081430;"No problem."
221;1083600;1086970;"Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money."
222;1086970;1089960;"You can leave. Right now."
223;1100110;1101700;"What are you doing?"
224;1102350;1103260;"Let's go."
225;1103260;1104010;"Huh?"
226;1104340;1105700;"We're gonna join my buddies."
227;1106300;1107560;"I'll introduce you."
228;1111820;1112910;"But..."
229;1116110;1118640;"Well, I won't force you."
230;1119780;1121600;"I'll just tell you this."
231;1121600;1122580;"Thank you."
232;1123560;1125240;"Uh, wait..."
233;1125570;1126740;"Actually..."
234;1130080;1131230;"It's okay if I come?"
235;1132570;1134630;"I mean, I'm just a..."
236;1136390;1137380;"What?"
237;1137980;1141240;"Was I the only one who thought 
we were already friends?"
238;1146210;1147220;"It's really..."
239;1148080;1149250;"okay?"
240;1149890;1151760;"It isn't about what's okay."
241;1151760;1153410;"It's whether you're coming or not."
242;1154310;1156760;"I'm going! I'm going with you!"
243;1163670;1165390;"I want to make something clear."
244;1166180;1168480;"The next time something like this happens,"
245;1168480;1170520;"I won't bother thanking you."
246;1171640;1176170;"So if something happens, 
and I end up helping you,"
247;1176640;1178760;"you don't need to thank me."
248;1180430;1182530;"Friends are supposed to help friends."
249;1185090;1187140;"From now on, we'll be working together."
250;1187140;1189110;"So we'll be helping each other."
251;1189520;1192790;"Supporting each other isn't a big deal."
252;1193760;1197240;"It'd be lame to thank each other 
for every little thing."
253;1199990;1202770;"Yeah, this is it."
254;1203580;1205900;"This is the world I wanted."
255;1206570;1209230;"The world I longed for and sought..."
256;1209550;1213160;"But deep down, I thought 
it was beyond my reach..."
257;1213600;1216500;"That it wasn't meant for me... 
And wouldn't happen..."
258;1217020;1218940;"I'd given up on this world."
259;1219580;1222520;"I thought it wasn't meant to be..."
260;1226100;1228240;"Killua, I'm..."
261;1228770;1231280;"I'm so happy, I could die!"
262;1231280;1233790;"Huh? Why are you crying?"
263;1234200;1235690;"Because..."
264;1236090;1238390;"Because you're doing this for me!"
265;1239470;1240910;"Come on..."
266;1241660;1243680;"I want to make one more thing clear."
267;1244770;1247550;"The world you're stepping into is far more brutal"
268;1248090;1250430;"than the world of the Chimera Ants."
269;1251980;1253930;"They may seem similar,"
270;1253930;1257860;"but there's a huge difference between 
risking a life and throwing it away."
271;1262640;1265020;"People staring death in the face every day"
272;1265020;1267410;"don't want to hear that someone's ready to die."
