4;10100;12280;"If there's something I can do, tell me."
5;12690;13910;"I'll do anything!"
6;94990;99990;"Defeat x And x Reunion"
7;106850;110000;"The results of the eighth chairman election"
8;110350;113270;"were promptly counted by Beans."
9;114770;120510;"Now, please take a look at the result of 
the eighth election for the 13th chairman!"
10;125620;126890;"Wow!"
11;126520;132770;"Eighth Election for the 13th Chairman 

1) Leorio 282 (44.4%) 
2) Pariston 250 
3) Mizaistom 58 
4) Cheadle 16 

Turnout: 95.4%"
12;126890;129380;"This puts Leorio in first place!"
13;129380;132670;"For the first time, Pariston hasn't 
finished in first place..."
14;133470;138820;"However, the first place vote-getter, Leorio, 
received only 44.4% of the vote."
15;138820;141240;"That was below the 50% requirement,"
16;141240;145540;"which means we'll finally have a run-off 
between the top two vote-getters."
17;149140;150290;"Are they serious about this?"
18;150290;152410;"Then I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want."
19;203540;205850;"Oh, it's Brother."
20;206840;207750;"Morning."
21;208220;209390;"Did you sleep well?"
22;210000;210850;"Uh-huh."
23;212530;213810;"Where are we?"
24;214190;215390;"The hospital."
25;216170;219680;"My friend is here, sleeping. He's very sick."
26;223110;226330;"I want to help get him"
27;227370;228930;"on his feet again."
28;235270;237250;"You want Something to take over."
29;240430;243980;"Boo! Just when I was able to spend time with you!"
30;244650;246110;"Don't worry."
31;246110;246890;"Like I told you..."
32;247860;249750;"We'll be together from now on."
33;250420;251340;"And that's a promise."
34;256720;257630;"Please help me."
35;261250;262460;"I knew it."
36;262870;265400;"Killua is the one person who doesn't 
have to follow the rules."
37;266790;269200;"Though I'll have to check"
38;269200;273960;"whether it's specific to Killua or something 
that happens after a wish is used to heal."
39;274850;276910;"Okay, I'll do it."
40;278060;281640;"Either way, the power to destroy and fix"
41;281640;285000;"can become a powerful tool 
if the user can be tamed."
42;289770;292440;"His utter lack of humanity and wicked ambition"
43;292950;296560;"deviate even from the path of an assassin."
44;298310;300620;"How tragic..."
45;300620;304270;"When he was being controlled, he suffered less."
46;324930;328650;"Alluka is only awake when Something is asleep."
47;329390;331930;"She spends less time as Alluka than one would think."
48;333650;336980;"The time after Something's requests 
aren't met and people die,"
49;336980;340860;"until Something makes the next level-1 request..."
50;344550;349660;"Or the time when request-making is paused 
after someone leaves Something"
51;349660;351830;"before her three requests are complete..."
52;354220;356860;"Or the time after Something fixes and falls asleep,"
53;357310;361210;"until someone else makes a wish 
to Alluka and has it granted..."
54;366550;370910;"Making this the last wish and never 
wishing to Something again"
55;370910;374630;"would be the best thing that could happen."
56;396840;399280;"Hand... Hand..."
57;436260;437150;"Please,"
58;437810;438820;"Something..."
59;439790;441200;"Please heal Gon!"
60;442520;443500;"'Kay."
61;486860;488590;"Such incredible power..."
62;490320;492050;"What's happening inside?"
63;492740;495000;"Who's doing this?"
64;517470;519830;"What is this?"
65;520610;523830;"I've never felt anything like this before."
66;524750;527310;"Are you serious? Are you serious?"
67;527310;529260;"Then I'm going to do whatever I want."
68;566130;567750;"Magnificent."
69;579880;582910;"I want this."
70;584470;585780;"This..."
71;586460;588020;"belongs to me."
72;596420;598890;"Then let me ask the two remaining candidates"
73;598890;602030;"if they have anything they want to say."
74;602890;607040;"If not, we will proceed with the final vote."
75;609850;611000;"It's futile."
76;611560;613800;"It doesn't matter what you have to say."
77;614210;617500;"Well, I have a feeling that 
this election is already over,"
78;617500;620050;"but I would like to ask Leorio-san a question."
79;621350;623310;"Can you answer this question for me again?"
80;624210;626680;"What will you do if you become chairman?"
81;627310;631290;"Leorio-san, can you please 
give us your answer again?"
82;631290;634000;"What will you do if you become chairman?"
83;634650;635820;"Save Gon!"
84;637060;639570;"And I'll make all of you help me!"
85;640690;641530;"That's all."
86;644380;647150;"This would have been the perfect time,"
87;647950;651320;"but I'm not God."
88;653440;656780;"In that case, do you have any 
plans for shuffling personnel"
89;656780;659000;"or restructuring the organization?"
90;660290;662260;"Of course not!"
91;662600;666600;"I don't even know why I'm 
standing here right now!"
92;668730;670320;"Naturally..."
93;670320;672350;"Those are all the questions I have."
94;673090;674610;"It's futile, Pariston."
95;675130;679860;"Everyone was aware of those answers 
when they voted for Leorio."
96;680520;685930;"His supporters applauded because they 
have every intention of backing him!"
97;686920;690300;"Do you have any questions for me?"
98;690300;693440;"No! Let's just get this over with!"
99;693700;694630;"I understand."
100;695330;698630;"Then I move for an emergency council."
101;702270;703140;"Huh?"
102;703830;705720;"Er, what are you saying?"
103;706500;707640;"An emergency council."
104;708190;713340;"In accordance with the Eighth 
and Ninth Hunter Commandments,"
105;713340;715400;"I move for a vote of confidence."
106;715830;720110;"The topic will be a revision of the Hunter 
Commandments and the Hunter Exam."
107;720110;724160;"First, I propose that we abolish the 
current Hunter Exam system."
108;725310;727860;"If you agree, please vote "yea.""
109;727860;729730;"If you disagree, please vote "nay.""
110;729730;731220;"Hold it right there!"
111;731710;734310;"During the Zodiac council, we decided"
112;734310;736510;"the Ten Commandments weren't to be touched!"
113;736510;739050;"That isn't relevant right now!"
114;739640;740300;"No."
115;740780;743050;"You're wrong, stupid tiger!"
116;743690;744930;"You're absolutely right."
117;745630;748280;"The council reached an 11-1 majority decision."
118;748280;751930;"I was the only one in favor of 
revising the Ten Commandments."
119;752460;756580;"If Cheadle-san or Mizaistom-san were 
standing on the stage now,"
120;756580;761570;"I would have deferred to the council and 
kept my mouth shut until the election ended."
121;761900;765520;"But both of them are out of the running."
122;765520;770080;"And Leorio-san has stated that he 
has no plan for the Association!"
123;770850;773160;"This is the only time"
124;773160;779000;"I can express my opinion as vice chairman, 
and not as a member of the Zodiacs."
125;779000;780960;"Don't you understand, Kanzai-san?"
126;781750;785970;"This is the only chance I will ever get!"
127;790340;793970;"Of course, I could use the Eighth Commandment"
128;793970;797570;"to override the council's decision 
and force the matter to a vote."
129;797570;799930;"But I wanted to avoid that."
130;800620;804740;"The Zodiacs are something precious 
that the former chairman left us."
131;805110;809630;"Hey, if you say something stupid, 
he'll pay you back ten times over."
132;811530;817080;"Honestly, part of me wishes to let this 
matter die without making waves."
133;817080;822660;"However, the late Teradein-san and 
Bushidora-san made an excellent point."
134;823710;826280;"The Third and Fourth Commandments"
135;826280;830760;"are suffering gravely as a result 
of the current exam process!"
136;831500;833990;"He doesn't want to win."
137;834410;836520;"He doesn't want to lose, either."
138;837040;838270;"You're right..."
139;839240;840900;"He's a spiteful person!"
140;841690;844440;"He doesn't care about winning or losing,"
141;844440;848760;"so with nothing to gain or lose, he can 
always stay dispassionate and calm,"
142;848760;852390;"while he manipulates others and plays the rules"
143;852390;855900;"against us in the worst way possible."
144;861690;862920;"May I say something?"
145;863820;865330;"Yes, what is it?"
146;868310;872810;"If Leorio wins, I volunteer to serve as an advisor."
147;873260;875910;"I promise to conduct a comprehensive review of"
148;875910;878940;"the Ten Commandments and 
Hunter Exam at that point."
149;879630;883190;"I won't let you grab any of the Teradein votes!"
150;883510;887070;"I'll counter every point you've made!"
151;887870;892220;"To everyone who's voting for 
the potential Leorio shows,"
152;892220;895470;"but who's concerned about 
how he will serve initially,"
153;895960;899400;"I will quell those concerns, even if it 
requires me to leave the Zodiacs."
154;899400;900330;"Hey, hey, hey!"
155;900810;903010;"I have no idea what you people are talking about."
156;903010;906590;"But I'm in a hurry to save Gon 
as quickly as possible!"
157;909550;911360;"Leorio!"
158;998760;1001180;"Gon!"
159;1009240;1010940;"Damn!"
160;1010940;1013950;"You had me so worried!"
161;1019860;1022900;"Leorio!"
162;1028800;1030460;"I'm so glad!"
163;1030990;1035370;"So glad!"
164;1037030;1039110;"Did I l look that bad?"
165;1039110;1042220;"Bad doesn't even begin to describe it!"
166;1042720;1044690;"Leorio, stop."
167;1045260;1047330;"He's healed now. Isn't that enough?"
168;1047740;1049240;"Yeah, you're right."
169;1066860;1069870;"Everyone was worried about you."
170;1071260;1072840;"Thank you... Thank you."
171;1074430;1075600;"He got us."
172;1076850;1080180;"Pariston wanted Leorio to be his final opponent!"
173;1081070;1086300;"Leorio no longer has the motive or 
support to become chairman."
174;1087250;1089020;"{\an8}You become chairman!"
175;1089020;1090310;"{\an8}Who's the bald guy?"
176;1089020;1095030;"Leorio, you can't tell Gon that Killua healed him."
177;1095360;1096780;"Huh? Why not?"
178;1097660;1098780;"You can't tell him!"
179;1099700;1102290;"For Killua's sake, promise not to tell him."
180;1102710;1105930;"O-Okay, got it."
181;1107500;1109540;"Pariston, when?"
182;1110710;1114620;"When did you predict that this would happen?"
183;1114970;1115890;"Huh?"
184;1116540;1117820;"No, no..."
185;1117820;1120110;"I don't have the ability to predict anything."
186;1120110;1122370;"This was pure coincidence."
187;1125320;1127690;"Please tell me. I want to know."
188;1128930;1131770;"It hurts to admit this, but I've been defeated."
189;1136860;1141820;"It was when Ging-san said he 
would run for chairman..."
190;1142190;1142890;"What?"
191;1143430;1145770;"After he said he would run,"
192;1146500;1148920;"I asked a question to provoke him."
193;1148920;1151210;"And he responded that Gon-kun wouldn't die, right?"
194;1152490;1153520;"Go visit him."
195;1153930;1155710;"He isn't going to die."
196;1157040;1158220;"In that moment,"
197;1158630;1163730;"I could see the scene that 
just transpired before us."
198;1165460;1169610;"Well, I anticipated Ging-san 
and I would stand on stage,"
199;1169610;1171700;"and Ging-san would ultimately win."
200;1172130;1173530;"At least, in my vision."
201;1175280;1179550;"First, since Ging-san said Gon-kun wouldn't die,"
202;1179550;1182990;"I knew that meant there was a way to heal him."
203;1183820;1189920;"And that if he became part of the 
election, I would never win."
204;1191490;1192750;"Do you understand?"
205;1193650;1197190;"That was the moment I was defeated."
206;1198530;1201340;"But Ging-san gave up on the election,"
207;1201340;1204600;"then Leorio-san arrived, and hit him."
208;1205050;1206100;"When he stood on stage"
209;1206470;1210680;"and talked about his friends risking 
their lives to save Gon-kun,"
210;1211330;1214860;"I finally saw the complete picture."
211;1215500;1218360;"I was assured of my victory a moment ago,"
212;1219130;1221940;"when I felt that immense power."
213;1223200;1227620;"I could sense that Gon-kun's friends had saved him."
214;1228110;1231550;"All that remained was to delay 
the vote until he arrived."
215;1231550;1235380;"Oh, I'll retract the earlier motion, 
so there's nothing for you to worry about."
216;1236960;1239630;"That was all the information you had?"
217;1240360;1245010;"<i>You</i> put your trust in someone 
you'd never met before?!"
218;1248780;1251770;"I trust Ging-san as an enemy."
219;1253310;1258150;"And these are the friends that 
Ging-san trusted to save his son."
220;1259350;1260400;"I trust them."
221;1261540;1263330;"Why wouldn't I?"
222;1275190;1277390;"Run for chairman!"
223;1277390;1279550;"I'll vote for you!"
224;1280100;1282180;"Get on stage and say something!"
225;1282180;1284300;"Speech! Speech!"
226;1284850;1287730;"Man, I don't know what to do."
227;1304940;1306050;"Ging?"
228;1310410;1312080;"This is bad."
229;1313530;1318000;"But, well, this was always gonna happen..."
230;1405600;1408340;"Gon has finally caught sight of Ging's back."
231;1408690;1411130;"What will he say to him?"
232;1411630;1413950;"Next time: Chairman x And x Release."
