1;8800;12840;"The revived King, now calling himself Meruem,"
2;12840;14730;"carried Pouf and Youpi back to the palace"
3;14730;18620;"in order to recover his memories."
4;26950;29660;"Pouf's main body is with the King!"
5;31530;34380;"They're heading toward the palace 
at an alarming speed."
6;38380;41270;"That probably means the chairman lost."
7;42870;46400;"What can the rest of us do?"
8;127980;132980;"Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective"
9;141870;143900;"What's happening?"
10;145400;147530;"Where is the Supreme Leader?"
11;153950;155530;"It won't stop following us."
12;156190;157340;"That's annoying."
13;158200;160260;"It's the enemy's power."
14;160790;163390;"I believe it won't disappear until we've damaged"
15;163390;165120;"the enemy's physical body."
16;166140;168490;"Ah, how interesting."
17;169550;170580;"I shall test it."
18;174360;177650;"Incredible, that's my..."
19;207170;208280;"I understand."
20;209320;213240;"My power was not meant for me."
21;213780;216980;"It was meant to be used by the King!"
22;217760;218710;"Youpi."
23;221120;222820;"This does not make sense."
24;226430;230580;"If you knew this power resulted 
from an enemy's attack,"
25;231390;234290;"that means either you saw it used,"
26;234290;238010;"or it was used on you."
27;240150;241270;"Which was it?"
28;248520;251140;"I was hit by an attack."
29;254430;258490;"I cannot see it following you now."
30;259900;262120;"So why does the enemy still live?"
31;265540;269190;"How did you free yourself 
from the enemy's power?"
32;270620;271600;"Answer me."
33;276850;278780;"We made an agreement."
34;280550;283050;"In exchange for releasing me from his power,"
35;283660;285050;"I agreed to spare his comrade."
36;287690;289670;"Then, after he released you,"
37;290200;293530;"you had the opportunity to finish 
him off along with his comrade."
38;294000;295560;"Why did you not do so?"
39;296350;299550;"Honestly, I'm not sure."
40;303250;308450;"I believe I felt that, if I had, 
I would have lost in some way."
41;309640;311740;"I felt that breaking a promise,"
42;311740;314480;"even a promise to an enemy,"
43;314480;316710;"would be equivalent to conceding defeat."
44;316950;318180;"Impossible!"
45;318180;320960;"You're saying that your personal emotions"
46;321280;325400;"were the reason you spared the lives 
of those who oppose the King?"
47;326800;330470;"I'm prepared to accept any punishment..."
48;331940;334290;"I have no excuses to offer."
49;339930;342610;"I only ordered that you not lie to me."
50;343050;349110;"I have no reason to punish 
those who speak the truth."
51;352500;353360;"Pouf."
52;353920;354870;"Yes!"
53;355270;356120;"Youpi."
54;356430;357250;"Yes!"
55;358110;360840;"We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies."
56;364620;368280;"Our bodies and souls have been linked..."
57;369170;373140;"It is no longer possible for the three of 
us to hide anything from one another!"
58;376650;378020;"Your Majesty!"
59;379000;380270;"Your Majesty..."
60;381580;382370;"Let us go."
61;382690;383550;"Yes!"
62;388460;389370;"Your Majesty..."
63;389980;393550;"Was that meant as a final warning"
64;394160;399660;"because you realize what I plan to do, 
and the guilt it makes me feel?"
65;401670;402880;"Nevertheless!"
66;403840;406790;"Even if it means I am executed for my crime..."
67;409280;410510;"I do this for the King!"
68;413980;415890;"Where is she? Find her!"
69;415890;416980;"Hurry up and find her!"
70;416980;418680;"For the sake of our species!"
71;418680;420100;"Where is she?"
72;420100;421900;"Find her!"
73;423660;425400;"She is not necessary!"
74;425400;426440;"Find her, quickly!"
75;426440;428170;"I do this for the King."
76;428170;428940;"Is she over there?"
77;428940;430390;"Wait! Not there!"
78;430390;431910;"No! That way!"
79;432610;433410;"Hey!"
80;435190;439920;"When you're split up, you can't hurt me."
81;444400;445840;"You're ignoring me?"
82;445840;447200;"Wait up!"
83;447200;450120;"You can't remove APR without defeating me!"
84;450590;453930;"Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me."
85;454920;456400;"Does the enemy who attached this"
86;456400;458180;"also have the ability to teleport?"
87;458390;459960;"That's someone else..."
88;459960;463310;"There's one who can make himself 
and those around him invisible."
89;463670;465500;"He looks like a chameleon."
90;465880;468780;"I don't know his name, but he's 
one of the Squadron Leaders."
91;469070;470940;"Which means he's a traitor!"
92;471410;476290;"So you spared not only humans, 
but a traitor, as well?"
93;477850;479760;"I'm willing to accept any punishment."
94;480330;481370;"Your Majesty!"
95;481370;483830;"Until we've defeated them, please..."
96;484110;486360;"I do not care. It is irrelevant."
97;486950;491940;"On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial"
98;491940;494340;"that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve."
99;497760;498660;"Youpi..."
100;499080;501880;"We must accept your emotional instability,"
101;501880;504130;"as well as the traitor's betrayal,"
102;504700;507770;"as we move forward."
103;508940;513000;"Humans are a sacrifice meant to help 
us attain the next level of evolution."
104;514100;515740;"The perfect sacrifice."
105;517950;520730;"Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution,"
106;521180;524170;"any lingering traces of the human ego will"
107;524170;526790;"be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait."
108;529510;534500;"The King's opinion had completely 
reversed following the explosion."
109;534500;536390;"Was it due to the impact?"
110;537790;538730;"No."
111;539320;540940;"This was the King, as well."
112;542310;544920;"If the enemy can become invisible,"
113;544920;546460;"I can find him by making contact."
114;547880;549360;"I need to split myself"
115;549360;552070;"into the smallest clones 
that can still retain sight,"
116;552530;554280;"and expand the search!"
117;560250;561530;"Bastard..."
118;562020;564660;"Clearly, I'm not his target."
119;565270;568670;"He turned back just like that... Who is he after?"
120;571090;573810;"Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?"
121;574580;576270;"That's bad, then!"
122;577230;582510;"I can't think of any way to defeat the 
King without Meleoron's ability..."
123;584280;587690;"I must protect Meleoron at any cost!"
124;591780;596230;"Pouf divided his clones to the point where 
they're too small for me to see."
125;596970;599360;"Unlike his main body, his clones have to be"
126;599360;602070;"at full size for me to see them."
127;606550;610210;"The man with the pompadour 
was obviously just a decoy."
128;610920;616340;"They must know we've realized 
that the chameleon is a traitor."
129;616960;622720;"In other words, they believe that I've 
returned to dispose of the traitor."
130;623800;629380;"Assuming the chameleon is concealing 
himself and the others as they flee,"
131;629380;631920;"and that the woman is among them,"
132;632480;637110;"if I get close, they will protect the 
chameleon and abandon her!"
133;638370;643240;"Because they believe the 
chameleon is my target."
134;643710;646130;"They must have never imagined that I'd return"
135;646130;650210;"to kill the woman that Pitou was 
trying so desperately to heal."
136;650710;656760;"If they believe I've returned to rescue 
the woman, it's even better!"
137;657310;662640;"They may even offer to hand her 
over to me with conditions."
138;667460;670690;"He must be after Meleoron."
139;671840;676050;"Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor."
140;676530;677410;"Hold on."
141;680170;681840;"Let's make sure."
142;702730;704570;"The door leading underground?"
143;706300;707610;"So that's it..."
144;707610;710770;"They realized that I know they 
can become invisible,"
145;710770;713150;"and decided to give me two options."
146;713690;718530;"The chameleon either ran inside 
or fled somewhere else."
147;719280;723780;"Their plan is to split up my clones 
further, to weaken me."
148;724990;727240;"No! Over there! Over there!"
149;727240;730660;"Over there! Over there! Over there!"
150;736420;737210;"What?"
151;751550;753410;"They're giving me two options."
152;753410;756810;"But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?"
153;758730;762230;"Then they want to know which is my target?"
154;763840;768300;"Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?"
155;768820;773320;"Or do I send the majority of them after 
the chameleon, to fool them?"
156;775350;777680;"Even if the shutter is closed,"
157;777680;780340;"I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized."
158;780920;782550;"No, I don't have time for that!"
159;788240;789620;"I'll go after"
160;790800;791970;"the woman!"
161;792850;794730;"So she's his target?"
162;795340;796860;"I only have to kill the woman"
163;796860;799730;"and hide her body from the 
King for a short time."
164;800130;801330;"My clone can manage that!"
165;801940;803240;"I only need a minute or two!"
166;816280;817430;"He's..."
167;819310;822720;"incredibly fast!"
168;824010;825740;"Then she's your target?"
169;826250;828190;"I'm up for a game of tag."
170;829550;831330;"I can go all night."
171;833480;835290;"Judging by how quickly he reacted,"
172;836730;840140;"it would be hard to catch him, 
even at full strength."
173;841560;843420;"If I don't hurry, the King will arrive."
174;843850;844920;"What do I do?"
175;845970;850450;"Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution."
176;851030;852160;"I know!"
177;852700;855410;"The greatest magic of all..."
178;858140;859400;"He split himself up?"
179;859400;862450;"But he won't be big enough to take her away!"
180;863950;867420;"Is he going to attack me first?"
181;868430;870050;"Your plan is going to backfire..."
182;871440;874480;"You've reduced your speed and power,"
183;874480;876180;"so I don't even need to use Godspeed."
184;876730;879170;"Cease this futile resistance."
185;879540;882820;"Your plans have already been thwarted!"
186;884380;888040;"What is the point in adding 
to your transgressions?"
187;888040;891570;"If it is fear of retribution driving 
you to flee, you needn't worry."
188;892570;894080;"The King will forgive you."
189;895150;897480;"He is a benevolent ruler."
190;898390;899730;"Don't make me laugh!"
191;899730;901450;"You think I'll believe that?"
192;901450;904950;"You'll probably tie me to a tree, 
and turn me into a soldier!"
193;906740;907840;"The King?"
194;912160;913270;"That's right..."
195;913270;914610;"Keep running."
196;915040;917600;"Take her far from the King first!"
197;918820;920310;"That confirms it..."
198;920310;921600;"I don't know the reason,"
199;922460;925050;"but this girl is important to the King."
200;926280;928960;"For Gon... For the sake of our mission..."
201;928960;931020;"I can't let the enemy have her!"
202;932580;934360;"That's right..."
203;934360;936280;"The person chasing us sounded like"
204;936280;938870;"one of the people with the Supreme Leader..."
205;940070;943680;"Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?"
206;944410;946010;"Then who is this person?"
207;946450;948790;"Who are the people he was with?"
208;949700;954390;"Your twisted sense of justice 
will never help the people!"
209;956780;959000;"First, I cast a spell on the woman."
210;959530;962650;"I use magic words to make her suspicious..."
211;963570;967610;"The King and I seek open dialogue."
212;968010;970900;"Now, release her at once!"
213;971280;974450;"Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney."
214;974450;975870;"What is he up to?"
215;975870;977340;"Let me go..."
216;978390;980640;"Please put me down!"
217;981160;982790;"Something's wrong with you!"
218;983400;985760;"You're all tingly!"
219;985760;987630;"What are you talking about, fool?"
220;987630;989760;"I'm trying to save you!"
221;989760;991110;"You're lying!"
222;991110;992160;"I'm lying?"
223;992160;994920;"You trust that insect more than you trust me?"
224;994920;996020;"Insect?"
225;996020;998560;"What are you talking about?!"
226;999940;1002710;"That's right... She can't see!"
227;999940;1003470;"Let go! Let me go!"
228;1002710;1004440;"That'll make it hard to explain."
229;1010500;1012800;"Damn... Almost."
230;1015400;1017860;"It didn't take long for the poison to kick in."
231;1017860;1022770;"If the woman you're carrying resists, 
your speed will also fall..."
232;1025440;1026890;"What's going on?"
233;1027630;1030460;"He wasn't aiming for me..."
234;1030460;1031800;"He was aiming for the woman."
235;1033400;1034800;"He was trying to kill her!"
236;1039560;1041390;"If she escapes, that's fine."
237;1041390;1043560;"If she distracts him with her resistance,"
238;1043890;1046570;"allowing me to kill her, even better!"
239;1048000;1049450;"Komugi-san!"
240;1049890;1052690;"The enemies consider you a valuable hostage."
241;1053370;1055900;"They will not kill you..."
242;1055900;1057260;"Keep struggling!"
243;1057260;1059000;"Keep fighting back!"
244;1059770;1061670;"I'll save you soon!"
245;1069870;1071840;"She was knocked out, so that's impossible."
246;1072530;1075780;"Well, I have no idea what's going on here,"
247;1076330;1079480;"but I know that you're making me mad."
248;1088280;1090180;"If you enter this ring,"
249;1092430;1093440;"I'll kill you."
250;1107210;1109200;"You may be a clone,"
251;1109200;1111630;"but you were formed from the original's cells."
252;1112800;1115380;"If I burn those cells, they die."
253;1116090;1117270;"Electricity..."
254;1119090;1122390;"Come on... I'll whittle you down."
255;1124720;1126390;"Are you having difficulty?"
256;1129020;1131150;"I can feel your impatience."
257;1131890;1133270;"I shall lend you a hand."
258;1134030;1135860;"It's nothing you need to worry about."
259;1136420;1140470;"Your first priority should be regaining 
your memories, Meruem-sama."
260;1141690;1145360;"Once my main body has returned, 
I can deal with the intruders easily."
261;1148040;1151290;"Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!"
262;1153070;1155780;"Humans, as far as we can see!"
263;1156130;1157800;"Do you remember now?"
264;1158500;1160530;"They are all here for you..."
265;1160530;1162430;"They all belong to you!"
266;1163500;1166030;"They belong to me?"
267;1166830;1169990;"You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures,"
268;1169990;1172790;"and stand atop the food chain."
269;1173460;1176910;"That is your glorious destiny!"
270;1177900;1179700;"As willed by the heavens!"
271;1191410;1193990;"Something isn't right..."
272;1196020;1200840;"There's still something else..."
273;1202050;1204220;"Something else I've forgotten."
274;1206130;1208280;"What are you saying?"
275;1208280;1212220;"Nothing could be more important 
than ruling over all life forms..."
276;1213900;1215360;"I suppose."
277;1216540;1219100;"Perhaps the explosion has left me confused."
278;1220380;1221360;"However..."
279;1225130;1226720;"The pain won't cease."
280;1228890;1232620;"Why is the palace in shambles?"
281;1233810;1236000;"It was destroyed in the battle."
282;1237100;1240380;"It happened after you left the palace."
283;1241120;1244380;"Where is the place I spent most of my time in?"
284;1245910;1248890;"It has been completely destroyed..."
285;1252780;1254900;"I suppose I should look at what's left."
286;1255350;1261150;"Yes, you may find something that will 
help you regain your memories..."
287;1265380;1266380;"This is bad!"
288;1267730;1268720;"That could be it..."
289;1269170;1270990;"The Gungi board and pieces!"
290;1273980;1276920;"They may be the key to awakening his memory!"
291;1277750;1280420;"I must dispose of them!"
292;1285110;1286770;"He gave up?"
293;1303770;1304980;"Over there."
294;1309740;1310710;"Let's go."
295;1404510;1406780;"Next time: Magic x Of x Despair."
296;1407210;1409120;"Killua, thanks."
297;1409120;1410340;"What's this about?"
298;1410340;1412030;"We're buddies, right?"
299;1412030;1413910;"Yeah, but still..."
300;1414470;1415620;"Thanks."
