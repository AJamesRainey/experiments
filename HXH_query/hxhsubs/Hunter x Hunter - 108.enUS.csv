2;6500;10080;"In the palace, the King has 
completed his recovery,"
3;10080;12860;"and continues to play Gungi without rest."
4;17240;18120;"That's checkmate."
5;26620;29380;"Her mind and body are at their limit."
6;29940;33900;"I estimate it will only take another 
match or two before the King wins."

8;124300;125510;"Time for a break."
9;125510;127220;"We will resume in a half day."
10;129400;131580;"Wait, I can keep going!"
11;131580;135170;"If you can barely sit straight, 
the victory won't satisfy me."
12;136170;138050;"Recover your strength."
13;145530;150000;"Even while his arm was being treated, 
the King never stopped playing."
14;150470;152670;"But now he changes his mind?"
15;156750;159260;"This female is dangerous."
16;160990;162260;"If this continues,"
17;163830;165700;"she could prove quite troublesome..."
18;180950;183780;"Then, I will excuse myself."
19;190800;192420;"I must not be too hasty."
20;193180;195450;"The King chose to retract his decree."
21;196060;198230;"In order to stay true to his convictions..."
22;199250;201570;"In order to defeat the Gungi 
Champion at her best..."
23;202010;204430;"In order to demonstrate his strength!"
24;205380;208700;"If I kill this girl now,"
25;208700;212660;"the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever."
26;213550;215640;"Her death will cement her status"
27;216090;219370;"as someone the King could never defeat!"
28;228650;230350;"I am such a fool!"
29;230760;237320;"My hasty impulse could have left 
the King with a permanent scar!"
30;249700;252380;"I shall die of my own volition!"
31;253270;256520;"Once I have seen the King conquer the world..."
32;265420;269340;"Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex, 
seven people will infiltrate the palace."
33;270050;271480;"Shoot and me..."
34;271480;273180;"Gon, Killua,"
35;273180;275220;"Meleoron, Ikalgo,"
36;275220;277340;"and then Morel."
37;277910;280590;"A few seconds after us,"
38;280590;283170;"the Chairman will enter from beyond Pitou's <i>En</i>."
39;283490;288300;"During that time, we must draw 
the Royal Guard from the King."
40;288850;291680;"Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first."
41;292780;296170;"When we suddenly appear 
in the midst of the palace,"
42;296170;299520;"their immediate reaction will be..."
43;300180;302290;"To protect the King with their lives."
44;302930;304790;"They'll probably use a formation like this."
45;305820;307940;"Breaking it won't be easy."
46;309580;311950;"And that's where I come in."
47;331990;334330;"Okay, any questions?"
48;334330;336850;"Uh, about Palm..."
49;337480;340440;"Can we do anything to learn 
what's happened to her?"
50;341000;343650;"She's either dead or in hiding."
51;344160;346200;"If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us."
52;346200;348240;"Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation."
53;349700;353070;"If she were captured, 
she'd have taken her own life."
54;353620;356160;"When she left, she was prepared for that."
55;356480;362290;"If we try to check in on her, 
it would be an insult to her resolve."
56;363420;365260;"Hey, you're being too harsh!"
57;365260;367880;"Gon's just concerned about Palm."
58;367880;370380;"And his concern is worthless."
59;370380;371300;"What's that?!"
60;371620;374180;"You just came back! Where do you get off?!"
61;374180;377840;"Assuming that Palm was captured alive,"
62;377840;381190;"it would mean the enemy knows our plan."
63;381530;386410;"Which would make us like moths 
flying straight into the flame."
64;386810;388200;"We'll be destroyed instantly."
65;389050;392290;"But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios,"
66;392290;394560;"what's important is that we trust Palm."
67;395110;397330;"Well, that certainly makes sense,"
68;397800;400380;"but Gon's point might be that,"
69;400380;404840;"if Palm has met such a fate, we still 
have time to change the plan."
70;405130;405840;"Think again."
71;406730;411790;"He'll say that we have to save Palm first."
72;412240;414970;"But he won't offer any plans for that."
73;415200;415930;"Right?"
74;415930;417510;"R-Right..."
75;418790;421210;"I see your point..."
76;422080;424160;"I know you're worried,"
77;424160;427230;"but once the operation starts, 
you'll have to forget her until we're done."
78;427750;431650;"If you're distracted for a fraction of a second,"
79;431650;435240;"that might cause our operation to fail."
80;436180;437500;"We still have two days..."
81;437970;440670;"There's still time for Palm to contact us."
82;449830;451260;"<i>Nyow</i> I understand."
83;457030;459880;"Should I have tried to escape to the right?"
84;460280;462020;"You should have moved your knight."
85;462660;467680;"I didn't want to let a single piece 
control the center of the board."
86;468360;472320;"Sometimes, you must accept 
the risk and move forward."
87;473080;477080;"Otherwise, you won't ever be 
able to make me hesitate."
88;478960;481210;"I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game."
89;486230;487210;"Your Majesty..."
90;487540;488240;"What is it?"
91;488700;491220;"I have some sensitive information, 
so we should step outside."
92;492200;493970;"It's fine, speak."
93;495770;499290;"Two days remain until the National Celebration."
94;499970;504740;"The number of citizens to process in Peijing 
has increased beyond our expectations."
95;505430;509950;"But the weather forecast is favorable, 
so the selection should proceed as planned."
96;510370;512990;"Get to the point."
97;513980;516530;"I would like to move up"
98;516530;518400;"the post-selection schedule."
99;518760;521380;"That's it? Do as you wish."
100;521800;522750;"Yes, sir."
101;522750;525870;"In that case, we will depart 
immediately after the selection—"
102;526070;527390;"Don't make me repeat myself!"
103;528460;530970;"I'm telling you to decide on your own."
104;531440;533810;"Do not return until I summon you."
105;538870;541390;"So you were chased out, too?"
106;542330;545140;"Well, we only need to wait for the King to win."
107;546050;549340;"You think that will only be a 
few more matches, right?"
108;549730;550350;"No."
109;551460;554190;"Wasn't that what you said a while ago?"
110;555000;558070;"The King is improving at a remarkable rate."
111;558680;560690;"However, she is also evolving."
112;562320;565910;"I am no longer able to predict the outcome."
113;567000;570800;"Well, it's still only a matter of 
time before the King wins."
114;571600;572880;"I hope you're right."
115;572880;576190;"I am. There's nothing to worry about."
116;583310;587060;"I am one hundred percent confident 
that he's acting on his own..."
117;588080;591320;"The man who defeated Leol."
118;592500;595180;"The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it."
119;595180;598240;"The soldiers under his control 
are all smoke puppets."
120;599320;602450;"Since their complex movements 
are not typical of </i>Nen<i> puppets,"
121;602450;604970;"they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen."
122;605580;610450;"He can't control as many puppets as I can, 
but his are more responsive."
123;613470;615210;"I want to fight him..."
124;615980;618720;"But I can't leave my post."
125;618950;621550;"Maybe he'll come to me..."
126;628390;631130;"It's about time for us to enter Peijing."
127;631130;635830;"The enemy should have noticed 
Morel's distraction by now."
128;637010;639250;"We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate"
129;639250;642030;"their belief that this is all the work of one man."
130;642710;644000;"At the same time,"
131;644000;647480;"many citizens will be moving toward the palace."
132;647860;650540;"If we disappear the day before the celebration,"
133;650540;655630;"they'll believe assassins are hidden 
among the citizens, trying to kill the King."
134;656550;661050;"And their focus will be outside 
the palace, on the crowds."
135;661990;665810;"That's when we enter the palace with 
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex!"
136;667490;669600;"The King will definitely be here."
137;670220;674780;"Watching the selection from 
the third-floor throne room."
138;677560;679240;"Will he really be there?"
139;680770;681990;"Something..."
140;682630;683780;"feels off."
141;698140;700260;"2-1-3, pawn."
142;701930;704010;"4-5-1, knight."
143;707140;709770;"8-7-2, lieutenant general."
144;711830;713770;"4-3-3, archer."
145;715490;719540;"She continues to attack where 
I'm weak without hesitation."
146;720200;722150;"As we play, she's getting sharper."
147;723680;725850;"2-1-1, knight."
148;728290;730600;"6-6-1, major general."
149;731210;733370;"But it does not pain me."
150;733930;735880;"Rather, I find this enjoyable."
151;736320;739500;"Because the board dictates my every move."
152;740780;746050;"Which proves that she is still 
several levels above me."
153;747120;749560;"How strong can she become?"
154;751720;753190;"Supreme Leader..."
155;754120;755190;"I feel..."
156;756120;757190;"strange."
157;766080;767540;"I can't stop."
158;769160;774850;"Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind..."
159;775610;779100;"I can become even better!"
160;780230;781590;"Has she awakened?"
161;782790;784590;"Then she's only"
162;785690;787250;"begun to grow."
163;793510;794530;"That's checkmate."
164;797300;801110;"Could I take a short break?"
165;801930;804430;"It's the first time she's asked for a break..."
166;805470;806800;"Is something wrong?"
167;807390;813130;"No, I'd like to return to my room to 
record the moves that are in my mind."
168;813130;814320;"But you can't see..."
169;814320;818380;"Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!"
170;818730;822820;"When I touch the pieces after they're placed,"
171;822820;825010;"I will never forget their position."
172;825620;827890;"She's memorized every placement 
she's ever experienced?"
173;828610;830680;"Very well, you're excused."
174;830680;831570;"Thank you."
175;833310;834530;"A foolish question..."
176;837480;838650;"Her name..."
177;840120;840950;"Hey."
178;842080;844650;"What is your name?"
179;845780;847470;"You mean mine?"
180;847840;849410;"Is there anyone else around?"
181;850260;852790;"It's K-K-Komugi."
182;853560;854770;"Komugi?"
183;856420;857920;"Supreme Leader..."
184;858910;861170;"Can you please tell me"
185;862070;864300;"what your name is?"
186;868660;870300;"My name?"
187;871660;872550;"What..."
188;875550;876850;"am I called?"
189;880120;880940;"Pitou."
190;884860;886820;"Yes, what do you need?"
191;888000;888570;"Pouf."
192;889390;890340;"Yes."
193;890340;891210;"Youpi."
194;891870;892690;"Yes."
195;895430;897030;"Is something the matter?"
196;897680;898590;"Pouf..."
197;898590;899330;"Yes?"
198;899600;901830;"Right, you're Pouf."
199;903700;904750;"Then..."
200;906120;908260;"What is my name?"
201;911500;913260;"I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty..."
202;914130;917730;"You are the King. You have no other name."
203;918240;920250;"You are the one and only King."
204;920690;925100;"At the moment, there are impostors 
using that name without permission,"
205;925100;927520;"but we will eliminate them all."
206;928110;933280;"So that the entire world will 
know there is only one King."
207;933280;935790;"That assumes the others can be eliminated."
208;936240;937790;""King" is a title."
209;938140;941800;"A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name."
210;943160;944250;"What of you, Youpi?"
211;945050;947840;"Your question is far beyond my capacity."
212;948260;951630;"I cannot think of a way to provide an answer."
213;952060;952910;"Pitou."
214;953810;958100;"I believe that your feelings 
are what matter most."
215;958830;964100;"You should select the name 
that you find most pleasing."
216;965810;967230;"Very well, then."
217;968740;972080;"You can choose a name after the selection."
218;972690;978710;"Right now, our priority is to finish all the 
preparations before tomorrow morning."
219;981950;983750;"Your Majesty, is something wrong?"
220;984320;987140;"If you have any concerns, we shall address them."
221;988080;990240;"That is why we are here."
222;990860;994730;"Komugi's entire body was glowing."
223;994990;996010;"Komugi?"
224;996010;997640;"The girl with the closed eyes."
225;1000840;1002860;"He's remembered that human's name."
226;1003530;1005150;"She experienced an awakening."
227;1005840;1011000;"Komugi will now become much stronger, 
although only at Gungi."
228;1012470;1013290;"Pitou..."
229;1013290;1014230;"Yes."
230;1014230;1016720;"If Komugi were put through the selection"
231;1016720;1020890;"that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?"
232;1020890;1022360;"She would die."
233;1022710;1024410;"The selection chooses humans"
234;1024410;1029290;"with the physical and mental 
strength to serve as soldiers."
235;1029740;1034350;"The survivors will be those who demonstrate 
excellent combat capabilities."
236;1036830;1038680;"Your Majesty, please..."
237;1039130;1040570;"After meeting Komugi,"
238;1041180;1043730;"I've learned that strength can 
manifest in different ways."
239;1044620;1047440;"For example, during our trip here..."
240;1047680;1050820;"Your Majesty, please stop."
241;1051160;1052840;"...I killed a child."
242;1052840;1055950;"Your Majesty, you must not say it..."
243;1056620;1058410;"Perhaps that child..."
244;1058410;1060660;"It isn't right... It's inappropriate!"
245;1060660;1065120;"...had the potential to surpass 
me in a certain field."
246;1065330;1066620;"An almighty King..."
247;1066960;1068790;"Yet I extinguished that potential."
248;1068790;1070920;"...can never show regret!"
249;1071590;1074560;"I extinguished it for no real reason."
250;1074560;1077550;"You must not say any more!"
251;1079230;1080300;"I am..."
252;1081880;1082770;"King!"
253;1097110;1100450;"I took a life for no reason at all..."
254;1103290;1106400;"What tremendous strength I must possess!"
255;1107300;1112520;"I appear with no warning, to rob 
countless beings of their inferior strength!"
256;1112900;1115290;"To crush... To destroy."
257;1116190;1118710;"That is my power."
258;1119470;1123070;"Brute force is the strongest 
power in this world!"
259;1132160;1135200;"I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard..."
260;1135200;1135990;"Why not?"
261;1136840;1139670;"I jumped to the wrong conclusion,"
262;1139670;1142200;"and I nearly insulted the King."
263;1143640;1149540;"I was foolish enough to think that the King 
might have regretted his actions..."
264;1150660;1153840;"You always think too much."
265;1153840;1156330;"Yes, that is correct."
266;1156330;1160890;"Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived."
267;1161190;1163140;"Yes, that is true."
268;1163560;1167770;"If the girl will impede the King, 
we should kill her."
269;1169420;1172650;"To think my mind operates 
on the same level as yours..."
270;1175130;1176400;"Yes..."
271;1177360;1181410;"My power is the strongest that exists."
272;1182520;1187790;"All other power means nothing
 in the face of my own."
273;1188260;1190380;"They are as dust in the wind."
274;1191230;1194590;"Komugi... That female is no different."
275;1195360;1199210;"Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game."
276;1199900;1204180;"I could turn her into no more than 
a source of meat with the barest touch."
277;1204890;1207800;"So her life depends on my mood."
278;1208290;1209810;"If I change my mind,"
279;1209810;1211510;"I can immediately kill her!"
280;1213280;1216820;"Then why am I so hesitant?"
281;1217550;1221320;"The goal was to kill time while 
waiting for the selection."
282;1221320;1224820;"The selection is tomorrow... 
Haven't I had enough?"
283;1225040;1227850;"I've had my fun. I no longer need her."
284;1228410;1230200;"Do I kill her now?!"
285;1245140;1247680;"Th-Thank you very much..."
286;1247680;1248850;"Why did you not call for help?"
287;1250330;1251120;"Here..."
288;1251500;1252560;"And here..."
289;1252560;1253940;"You're covered in blood!"
290;1254510;1256690;"Damn, I don't believe it."
291;1257660;1259820;"She's such a fragile creature!"
292;1261040;1262920;"Because it's still early..."
293;1264670;1268450;"I don't want to bother anyone else."
294;1269170;1271450;"You aren't bothering anyone."
295;1272770;1274460;"What am..."
296;1275110;1276840;"You are an important guest!"
297;1277300;1278460;"...I saying?"
298;1279840;1282760;"Didn't I come here to kill her?"
299;1291870;1292880;"Why do you cry?!"
300;1292880;1294070;"Why can't I do it?"
301;1294530;1296080;"I'm sorry!"
302;1296080;1297840;"But... But..."
303;1298250;1301230;"No one's ever been this nice to me!"
304;1305820;1308460;"What is this creature?"
305;1310410;1312240;"What do I want"
306;1313410;1314730;"to do with her?"
307;1404620;1407430;"Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action."
308;1407720;1411790;"Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas 
keep flooding into my mind—"
309;1411790;1414300;"Then we're covered for future preview segments!"
