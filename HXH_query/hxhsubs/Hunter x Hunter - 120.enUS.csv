1;6900;7920;"No way..."
2;8800;11600;"Where did he go, in that condition?!"
3;12730;13940;"Shoot..."
4;95990;100990;"Fake X And X Real"
5;112590;114300;"You intend to fight?"
6;115060;119480;"You will abandon your original plan, and 
commit yourself to a baseless assumption?"
7;123520;125060;"You really believe..."
8;140770;143060;"Smoky Jail, undo!"
9;145160;147340;"I see you've made your decision."
10;147910;150500;"Once I stopped to think about it, 
it was pretty simple."
11;150500;153040;"You used your cocoon after I played my card."
12;153740;156640;"Since you went into hiding 
only after learning my agenda,"
13;156640;158620;"I knew that was your ability,"
14;158900;160470;"and that it was a trap."
15;161710;166480;"Your lack of reaction when I lifted 
my pipe to strike confirmed it."
16;167610;172520;"It made no sense that you showed 
no sign of reacting at all."
17;181280;182790;"Fifteen minutes."
18;185400;188900;"That was how long I expected you to take"
19;188900;192210;"before deciding to remove the smoke barrier."
20;193510;199470;"During that time, I intended to slip 
through the smoke and move freely."
21;200690;205230;"You trapped me within that barrier 
to separate me from the King, yes?"
22;205750;208460;"Meaning, as long as your 
prison of smoke was there,"
23;208460;213560;"your allies would see it and 
conclude that I was still inside."
24;214980;216920;"I decided to take advantage"
25;216920;220260;"of that misconception, and 
quietly dispose of your friends."
26;220980;226020;"I knew you would hesitate long enough 
to give me plenty of time to act."
27;227060;230420;"You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes 
waiting in front of an empty cocoon?"
28;230420;232760;"You really underestimated me."
29;233140;236560;"No, on the contrary, it appears..."
30;240580;241740;"I overestimated you!"
31;246800;248890;"He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?"
32;251330;257060;"If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail, 
I wouldn't have seen a thing!"
33;267650;270000;"You should have waited longer..."
34;270370;273290;"Because my strategy was a last resort."
35;274280;280170;"To be honest, I was upset by the 
fact that I'd been trapped."
36;280450;282080;"Not a very good diversion strategy."
37;282080;283530;"You just contradicted yourself."
38;284280;286760;"You made it through the smoke just fine!"
39;287670;292690;"At that point, that was all there was to it."
40;293920;298190;"I was under the impression that 
you were a more capable soldier..."
41;298570;301430;"One who would carry out his original 
plan and be faithful to his mission."
42;301880;305950;"However, you made some wild guesses 
and removed the barrier."
43;306640;308950;"I must thank you."
44;308950;309910;"Thank you."
45;309280;310340;"Thank you. Thank you."
46;310340;312610;"Thank you. Thank you."
47;311390;313110;"Thank you."
48;313110;314960;"Thank you. Thank you."
49;324370;325800;"Deep Purple!"
50;327790;329530;"Run!"
51;342560;344540;"I can't destroy them?"
52;344540;346780;"They just break up and reform?"
53;347700;348780;"He's invincible?"
54;350950;353790;"Thank you! Bye-bye!"
55;354460;356000;"Don't be fooled..."
56;356000;357890;"He's playing mind games!"
57;358310;361540;"My decision to attack the 
cocoon was the best option."
58;362100;366430;"No, the moment I second-guess myself, 
I've played into his hands."
59;367170;368550;"My next job"
60;368970;371860;"is to predict his objective, and stop him..."
61;373140;375390;"To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard,"
62;375740;378310;"to find and eliminate my companions,"
63;378560;380550;"and to reunite with the King!"
64;380770;381810;"That must be it..."
65;382680;384730;"His interests are consistent with mine."
66;385230;386320;"There's no problem!"
67;397560;399580;"I'll take this!"
68;402030;403090;"He's fast!"
69;403460;405840;"I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!"
70;409240;410800;"He got me..."
71;410800;412960;"I can't use any other abilities."
72;412960;415680;"If Deep Purple is undone, 
I'll be completely helpless!"
73;416160;419160;"I'll have to find a way to get by, 
using Deep Purple alone."
74;423840;426110;"Yo, are you"
75;426890;428240;"the esper?"
76;437650;441250;"What'd you do with Shoot, huh?"
77;441930;442750;"What?"
78;445220;447500;"Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets..."
79;447670;449870;"The maximum number I could 
produce in my current state."
80;449870;453260;"I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can."
81;460490;462270;"I see what you're doing..."
82;462620;464480;"I'll let you hit me once."
83;464830;466020;"But in return..."
84;471150;473000;"I'll take your life!"
85;480950;483240;"Okay, no one's here."
86;483860;485590;"This is our chance to escape."
87;485590;486540;"Let's go."
88;487520;491240;"Man, they said we'd be safe here."
89;491240;494280;"I can't get in touch with Leol-sama."
90;494990;500030;"Since my stomach shrunk, that probably 
means Cheetu-sama's dead..."
91;500030;503560;"And I haven't heard anything from 
Flutter, so I guess that's it."
92;503970;507060;"I'll leave to become a Queen!"
93;507450;510060;"I'll make you my second-in-command."
94;510060;511330;"How's that?"
95;512370;514070;"Help..."
96;516180;517590;"Please..."
97;517590;519200;"get me out of here..."
98;520150;521200;"Help!"
99;522050;524100;"Oh, Secretary Bizeff..."
100;524100;525070;"You're in trouble."
101;525070;527250;"I can't move my legs..."
102;532600;533970;"Whatever, let's go."
103;533970;535170;"This looks dangerous."
104;535170;537300;"What? Wait... Please!"
105;537690;539450;"I'm going to die!"
106;539800;543320;"No can do... I can't move all that."
107;543320;545890;"Then, could you call for help?"
108;546610;548960;"Like, seriously..."
109;548960;551940;"I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!"
110;552180;555510;"The boss is missing, our link 
with the King is gone,"
111;555510;556780;"and the palace is a mess."
112;557300;560450;"I have no reason to stay here!"
113;560450;561910;"I'll give you whatever reward you want!"
114;562150;564660;"There are mountains of treasure underground!"
115;566360;569670;"If you help me, I'll give you anything you want."
116;569670;572260;"So please pull me out!"
117;572740;574340;"Where underground?"
118;574340;578230;"There's an area for the Supreme 
Leader beyond the shelter."
119;578230;580840;"I've been managing the treasure inside."
120;581230;583820;"I'm the only one with access..."
121;584900;587430;"You'll give me anything I want?"
122;598470;600530;"You'd better keep your promise."
123;600530;602730;"Or I'll kill you!"
124;603350;606550;"Treasure! Treasure!"
125;606550;609790;"Treasure, treasure, treasure!"
126;610120;611360;"It's over..."
127;611870;613430;"This nation is finished."
128;613900;616310;"That was clearly proven"
129;617340;621220;"when the air assault began before 
I was able to make any arrangements."
130;622190;627230;"They're probably calling the Ants biological 
weapons, to use them as an excuse..."
131;627800;630610;"If I'm captured by the Federation,"
132;630610;635590;"they'll force me to confess for a cover 
story and throw me in prison for life,"
133;635590;637460;"or they'll execute me, so I can't talk."
134;640500;642190;"<i>I won't let them capture me...</i>"
135;642190;643860;"<i>I'm going to escape!</i>"
136;651140;653890;"The smoke-user is now out of action."
137;654810;656660;"Now, I'll go back to the palace,"
138;656660;659510;"evaluate the current situation, 
and return to the King."
139;660290;665270;"Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him, 
the King will only find me a nuisance."
140;666700;667930;"Beelzebub!"
141;666850;670270;"{\fad(901,1)}Lord of the Flies
Beelzebub"
142;674320;676960;"Go forth, my clones..."
143;676960;680030;"Identify the location and status of 
every person inside the palace!"
144;682640;685890;"Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him"
145;685890;689790;"to disassemble into copies of himself 
as small as one billionth his size."
146;690290;695100;"He was able to control the size 
and number of copies produced,"
147;695100;698770;"and the smaller the copies, 
the more he could produce."
148;699570;702280;"However, his main body,"
149;702280;706180;"which served as a control center, 
could only be reduced to a bee's size."
150;706950;711400;"Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier,"
151;711400;714040;"my main body could not have escaped."
152;714510;717880;"My combat capacity would 
have been reduced by half."
153;719540;722530;"I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself"
154;722530;728260;"must know the incomparable difference in 
strength between a clone and your own body."
155;730050;733310;"Now that my main body is free, 
I have no weaknesses."
156;733310;735170;"You have lost."
157;735540;738910;"You should have been more careful."
158;739390;741120;"If you had, then when you realized"
159;741120;743840;"the cocoon was empty, 
you should have wondered"
160;743840;748390;"whether what had been inside it 
had actually escaped the barrier."
161;749730;753410;"And if I had spoken to you 
from outside the barrier,"
162;753410;756520;"you should have wondered whether 
that was my real self."
163;757540;763340;"The plan I executed was an act of desperation."
164;763760;769160;"I could attempt to confuse your allies, 
but my clones are mere husks."
165;769790;773310;"Assuming that your allies were as strong as you,"
166;773310;776670;"even if it took a few casualties, 
they would have noticed"
167;777200;778920;"that my clones were fakes!"
168;781330;785980;"Had you comprehended the truth, 
and realized that my main body"
169;785980;789180;"remained within the barrier,"
170;789820;795940;"you would have understood my 
ability, and searched for me."
171;797460;798800;"If you had done so,"
172;798800;803820;"I would have had no way to 
fight you in my reduced state..."
173;805830;810600;"In other words, if you had maintained 
the barrier as per your original goal,"
174;810600;813100;"your allies may have suffered a bit,"
175;813100;815660;"but you would have been able to defeat me."
176;816270;820500;"And I was ten-percent resolved 
to accept that fate."
177;821800;825040;"Your emotions were perfectly 
aligned to accomplish that."
178;825520;828660;"I suppose the explosion 
must have thrown you off."
179;828660;830260;"A pity..."
180;832050;834850;"However, I am now free."
181;835620;838810;"Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!"
182;840200;847620;"From the start of the mission, 
Morel's condition was less than optimal."
183;848650;854480;"His exhaustion and impatience, combined 
with the extreme tension of the situation,"
184;854480;859710;"clearly led him to the hasty decision 
to engage Pouf in a battle of nerves."
185;860490;865340;"However, he arrived at the 
perfect time to support Knuckle,"
186;865340;867610;"keeping him from engaging Youpi alone."
187;868280;873160;"As a result, it could be said that 
he made the correct decision"
188;873160;875640;"to remove Smoky Jail at that time."
189;876430;880510;"And it was more than simply 
a product of coincidence."
190;880940;886030;"It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of 
experience played a role in saving him."
191;887570;890220;"Upon entering the palace,"
192;890220;893110;"Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies"
193;893110;895590;"against that of his allies."
194;895960;900670;"Subconsciously, he knew that they 
had underestimated the enemy."
195;901280;907670;"When he realized the length of time his allies 
could hold out was shorter than anticipated,"
196;908110;915420;"he was led to attack the cocoon in order 
to avoid struggling with the pros and cons"
197;915420;919240;"of removing Smoky Jail to go help them."
198;919780;925690;"Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge 
of the battlefield, saved his comrades."
199;929450;933620;"The real one's hidden among the fakes, 
trying to attack me, right?"
200;934240;937290;"This time, I'll land a counter on you!"
201;944340;945920;"Five were taken out..."
202;945920;947460;"I have eighty-four left!"
203;952030;954570;"The smoke ones are fake."
204;954570;955760;"They feel completely different."
205;956480;960140;"When the real one lands a hit, I'll know."
206;961100;963520;"{\fad(1,349)}That's when you'll be finished!"
207;965870;967260;"Seventy-five left!"
208;967690;968610;"Seventy-two..."
209;969410;970650;"Seventy..."
210;978790;981910;"Pitou and the woman are on the 
west tower's second floor."
211;982350;984240;"Pitou appears to be healing the woman."
212;984650;987240;"A boy, who appears to be an 
enemy, is sitting nearby."
213;988830;991420;"Three near the entrance to 
the underground shelter..."
214;991950;994730;"Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!"
215;995100;996510;"They may be heading underground."
216;997090;998690;"Welfin is behind them."
217;999100;1001290;"He appears to be following them."
218;1002340;1005940;"The woman was injured by the dragon spears."
219;1006850;1010260;"But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?"
220;1011170;1012950;"Could he be acquainted with the woman?"
221;1013840;1016450;"One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower..."
222;1016970;1019070;"The human captured a few days ago."
223;1020450;1022160;"It will be born soon."
224;1023120;1025130;"Oh, this area's crazy..."
225;1025130;1026580;"There are lots of enemies."
226;1027220;1029090;"One, two, three..."
227;1030270;1032280;"But Youpi is taking them out quickly."
228;1033390;1036590;"Youpi and approximately fifty enemies 
are in the north area of the palace!"
229;1037590;1040180;"It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs."
230;1041230;1043470;"Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!"
231;1043890;1045260;"Unable to determine if it is friend or foe."
232;1046750;1049420;"Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?"
233;1049910;1054360;"Only one of the thugs is real, 
while the rest are made of smoke."
234;1054950;1057190;"The number of puppets is not increasing"
235;1057190;1059930;"because he needs the pipe to make more."
236;1060590;1064370;"It'll take Youpi less than a minute 
to find the real one."
237;1066570;1069130;"The King is gone! Where is he?"
238;1070090;1072730;"Everyone, return!"
239;1084840;1086060;"What's wrong?"
240;1086060;1088150;"You're running out of clones."
241;1088450;1093650;"My attacks are too fast for you to get close."
242;1095140;1101160;"Should I leave an opening for 
him to come in and attack?"
243;1101860;1103150;"Carefully..."
244;1104290;1105680;"Act natural."
245;1106980;1108850;"Here you go..."
246;1109920;1110670;"Come on!"
247;1131060;1132190;"He's a fake?"
248;1135150;1136650;"Wait..."
249;1137490;1140450;"You finally figured it out, idiot?"
250;1141480;1144570;"There never was a real one."
251;1150310;1151960;"I'll kill you!"
252;1157240;1159720;"There<i> is</i> a real one, right here!"
253;1160430;1162760;"No kidding!"
254;1171180;1172610;"An aura explosion?"
255;1173060;1173940;"From Youpi?"
256;1174500;1176760;"Did he really need to use such an ability?"
257;1184940;1186740;"I'm worried..."
258;1187400;1191070;"But locating the King is my first priority!"
259;1192690;1194440;"You saved me, boss!"
260;1194790;1196750;"If you hadn't set that restriction,"
261;1196750;1199160;"I would have snapped and rushed him!"
262;1201740;1202650;"Listen to me..."
263;1203280;1206810;"I will create only angry clones of you"
264;1206810;1210820;"when you've lost control of your temper."
265;1211480;1215510;"If that happens, you are to join the clones,"
266;1215510;1218560;"and give careful thought to what must be done."
267;1219320;1220790;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
268;1220790;1222320;"I got it."
269;1223650;1226530;"After cooling down and thinking about it,"
270;1226530;1229770;"I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot."
271;1230420;1234720;"But if Shoot couldn't move on his own, 
who would have moved him?"
272;1235770;1237710;"Damn... Stop thinking about it!"
273;1238240;1241300;"I need to focus on the opponent before me!"
274;1247780;1249020;"Where..."
275;1251090;1252210;"am I?"
276;1257780;1258770;"That's..."
277;1270490;1273080;"Uh-oh!"
278;1273470;1275120;"Hurry up!"
279;1275120;1276960;"Go in before the entrance is blocked!"
280;1277920;1280710;"Damn, Bizeff is my prey!"
281;1281430;1285210;"If I knew what powers they had, 
I could make a move."
282;1300850;1304740;"Don't come any closer..."
283;1307180;1307990;"Pouf!"
284;1404990;1407310;"Next time: Defeat x and x Dignity."
285;1407670;1409170;"I'm Gon."
286;1409470;1410720;"And that's all there is to it."
287;1410720;1412450;"I'm Killua!"
288;1412450;1413830;"And that's all there is to it."
