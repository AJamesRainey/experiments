make it to the second floor."

positioned them with that in mind."
21;258650;261240;"They were just decoys?"
22;264460;266240;"That resistance..."
23;266970;268990;"This is more than smoke!"
24;274360;277000;"The weapon was the only 
thing that wasn't smoke?"

31;310290;311040;"That..."
32;311680;315140;"That punch was meant to send 
him flying over the horizon."

39;343420;345260;"The enraged Youpi"
40;346110;350900;"returned to his senses because his multiple 
eyes had caught sight of a shadowed form."
41;357590;360150;"With his right leg broken,"
42;360150;364330;"Shoot unconsciously used his remaining 
leg to stand on one of his own fists."
43;365110;368800;"Despite that he had never attempted it before,"
44;368800;373320;"Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique."
45;379600;384710;"And he had no clear reason 
to cover his right eye."
46;386220;389580;"He was just enjoying the fact"
47;389580;393970;"that he continued to gain strength 
while the situation deteriorated."
48;403130;404960;"Fueled by adversity itself,"
49;408680;410450;"Shoot took flight."
50;430860;433510;"His tremendous speed and vigor"
51;433860;439910;"succeeded in forcing Youpi to 
concentrate on defense for a few seconds."
52;442460;443590;"All in order"

54;450820;453390;"Shoot, Knuckle..."
55;459610;465320;"Once we finish this, first thing we do 
is drink ourselves silly with good alcohol."
56;466500;471740;"That's the only way I can get you guys 
to let me give you a big hug."
57;475120;478650;"The debris cloud raised by the destruction"
58;478650;483220;"was the perfect cover for Morel to expand 
his smoke aura throughout the palace"
59;483220;485600;"so he could monitor the course of the battle."
60;487400;490170;"Morel's objective was the throne room."
61;492490;495740;"When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,"
62;497590;503140;"Gon and Killua evaded the attack 
and changed direction."
63;516200;517990;"They planned to jump from"
64;517990;523080;"the east tower's second floor to the central 
tower's third floor, where the throne room was."
65;523900;528230;"Upon hitting the ground, they passed 
Ikalgo in the courtyard as he headed"
66;530670;532120;"for the elevator underground."
67;534300;537690;"His ability that let him control corpses 
like part of his own body,"
68;538000;543380;"Living Dead Dolls, granted him 
the use of multiple sets of eyes,"
69;543590;546730;"which had allowed him to 
dodge Dragon Dive unscratched."
70;553990;557630;"In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted"
71;560520;562550;"two soldier Ants in the direction"
72;564400;566370;"that Ikalgo was headed."
73;576890;580130;"In the next moment, Killua had taken off."
74;625790;626740;"Killua?"
75;627310;629260;"Why is he heading toward the elevator?"
76;633200;634990;"What am I doing?"
77;635810;637130;"What's wrong with me?"
78;637600;641790;"It was only natural that Killua would 
be surprised by his own actions."
79;642810;644870;"He was the one"
80;644870;648500;"who had instructed the others 
to stick to their own tasks."
81;650190;653520;"At that point, Killua's mind completely froze."
82;669410;674280;"However, while his mind panicked,"
83;678440;681630;"his body continued to move efficiently,"
84;682420;686870;"keeping aura usage to a minimum,"
85;689990;693030;"while swiftly and accurately"
86;698550;703720;"gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities 
and movements, and halting them."
87;711620;715780;"Only Ikalgo and one other 
saw what had happened."
88;741760;742970;"Damn..."
89;744270;745510;"What have I"
90;747690;749290;"done?"
91;800100;801030;"Killua,"
92;803870;805030;"I owe you one."
93;808810;812980;"After he realized what he'd done, 
a tangle of emotions"
94;813490;816270;"had left Killua lost in confusion,"
95;816750;818820;"until Ikalgo's words woke him."
96;827370;830890;"By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,"
97;831860;834960;"Killua was already moving on."
98;839510;840740;"Flutter?"
99;843860;845240;"Something's wrong."
100;846650;853520;"At either end of the hall leading to the 
elevator underground were the servant quarters,"
101;853520;856600;"which soldier Ants currently occupied."
102;858560;862000;"Ikalgo raced past the two Ants,"
103;862530;866010;"and at the moment when he reached the elevator,"
104;869720;874670;"the doors at both ends opened simultaneously."
105;876000;879280;"From the doors appeared..."
106;887960;888970;"Cheetu..."
107;891370;892440;"Brovada!"
108;899000;901560;"After seeing Flutter,"
109;901560;905580;"Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled 
that something was wrong."
110;908550;909870;"That was too fast."
111;911980;915800;"Once they spotted the enemy, 
the two soldiers raised an alert."
112;916290;918520;"Right afterward, they were killed."
113;918970;923180;"The time between the intruder's 
return down the hallway"
114;923790;929220;"and Flutter's appearance was too short!"
115;932000;938070;"Which means they must have passed 
one another in the hallway."
116;938810;942250;"Then why were the soldiers killed,"
117;942560;945000;"but not Flutter?"
118;946370;948070;"Is Flutter on the enemy's side?"
119;948520;949540;"Meaning..."
120;950780;951860;"He's a traitor!"
121;953960;955560;"Is he acting on his own, or..."
122;957410;959140;"Is it Hagya's... Or rather..."
123;960560;962670;"Leol's orders?"
124;979500;981380;"This is pathetic."
125;982820;985130;"When he needed me most, I wasn't there."
126;986160;988860;"And I call myself a Royal Guard?"
127;990600;992760;"I don't even know where the King is."
128;994420;997230;"And I call myself a Royal Guard?"
129;998950;999680;"No."
130;1002270;1003970;"I am a failure!"
131;1007100;1008760;"It's that simple..."
132;1011150;1016390;"Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak."
133;1018840;1022960;"The ideals he prioritized were 
unyielding and absolute."
134;1032180;1034460;"Pouf, the former Royal Guard."
135;1034970;1036350;"Now, Pouf..."
136;1036350;1037810;"Useless Pouf..."
137;1038250;1039720;"You utter fool."
138;1040330;1042610;"You failure of a Royal Guard!"
139;1043330;1044980;"Where will you go now?"
140;1045370;1047090;"You have no idea?"
141;1048080;1050840;"And if the King isn't there,"
142;1050840;1053990;"then you'll be more useless 
than scum, won't you?"
143;1054910;1057980;"No, useless Pouf..."
144;1058940;1061310;"You just refuse to accept reality."

153;1095070;1097180;"That's probably where the King is..."
154;1100810;1105260;"Before I came here, I knew that much."
155;1105910;1110640;"I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because 
I didn't know the King's location."
156;1111420;1115210;"I failed because I knew where, 
and I didn't go there!"
157;1116590;1120180;"Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum."
158;1121180;1123700;"You are now a mere bug!"
159;1124430;1126760;"You can no longer expect anything of yourself."
160;1127600;1131790;"Nor are you allowed, then, 
to expect anything of the King!"
161;1132860;1135280;"I can only work for the King..."
