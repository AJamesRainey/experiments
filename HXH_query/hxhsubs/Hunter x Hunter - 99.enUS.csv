by new Chimera Ants."

6;21250;22040;"From the left?"

9;32170;32900;"Damn..."
10;32900;36620;"The bat's wings are so loud, 
I can't hear the owl at all!"

higher frequency than other animals'."

and your clothes rustling."
14;134910;138280;"All of which tell me exactly where you are!"
15;139530;140530;"From the right this time!"
16;146690;149230;"The owl uses its feathers to distract me"

18;151290;153790;"They're using both long- and short-range attacks."
19;154870;155720;"Wait..."
20;156220;157170;"That means..."
21;160530;163350;"He has a lot of aura... But it won't help."
22;164330;166850;"We are unrivaled in the darkness!"
23;167500;168960;"I should approach this the opposite way!"
24;169580;172400;"If the owl is acting in a support role,"
25;172400;174540;"I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings."
26;176380;179610;"Right after the owl attacks, 
the bat will attack!"
27;180190;181100;"Now!"
28;183970;185240;"Bingo!"
29;187230;188430;"I missed?"
30;188430;189690;"But my timing was perfect!"
31;190220;191370;"Ultrasonic waves?"
32;195070;197250;"Damn, I missed again?"
33;197570;201940;"Bah, he's correctly guessing 
the direction of my attacks."
34;201940;204510;"For a human, his ears are sharp."
35;204780;207000;"And his aura keeps growing,"
36;207000;209920;"so my feathers aren't doing any damage."
37;211010;215880;"The bat uses ultrasonic waves to 
anticipate the timing of my attack."
38;216220;219610;"Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!"
39;223970;226810;"First comes rock..."
40;227280;229580;"His aura continues to grow."
41;229580;231250;"This could pose a problem."
42;231250;232160;"Not at all..."
43;232420;234020;"This is our chance."
44;234020;236130;"He's probably using his ultimate attack."
45;236130;238170;"If we can evade it, we've won."
46;238540;241170;"I can use my ultrasonic waves 
to see it in advance."
47;241370;242990;"Do you need help?"
48;242990;246300;"Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can."
49;250450;251930;"The sound's moving away."
50;260200;261820;"The sound's gone!"
51;262320;263580;"Now, with no wingbeats..."
52;265740;266820;"I dive!"
53;267340;268330;"That won't work!"
54;268610;273080;"Your wings aren't like the owl's, 
so I can hear you slice through the air."
55;273440;276830;"Now, show me your ultimate attack."
56;278040;279230;"He isn't acting?"
57;280480;282660;"I guess a human can only hear so much."
58;282660;284480;"In that case, I'll make my move..."
59;284480;286370;"I'll slash your jugular!"
60;288200;290100;"Keep my motions minimal."
61;291040;293350;"Wait until I draw her as near as possible!"
62;293860;295300;"He was baiting me?"
63;295300;296100;"I'm in trouble."
64;296830;300440;"But his punch will take a 
few milliseconds to land."
65;300440;302670;"I have plenty of time to fly away!"
66;307850;308790;"The noise..."
67;309800;310980;"I can't see."
68;312320;313980;"I must get away!"

74;322420;324350;"Paper!"
75;325550;326350;"All right."
76;330280;331040;"A rock?"
77;331660;333410;"He used that to deflect my shot?"
78;334520;337940;"{\fad(648,1)}Gorilla Mode"
79;335380;337400;"That was close..."
80;337400;338420;"Damn it!"
81;338420;340730;"I used my special attack and 
still couldn't bring it down!"
82;352640;353700;"What was that?"
83;353700;356140;"There was a sound that made my head spin."
84;356760;358340;"Is this ultrasound, too?"
85;359230;361880;"That stupid kid has a loud voice..."
86;362880;366970;"But I'm much better at attacking with sound!"
87;367830;370900;"This is the true power of their combination."
88;370900;373230;"They strike with sound and finish with brawn."
89;375290;376730;"What now?"
90;377080;378500;"Do I cover my ears?"
91;378500;379720;"No, I can't..."
92;379720;383230;"In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing, 
my reaction time will suffer."
93;383540;384280;"I know!"
94;384640;385610;"Gyo!"
95;386900;388620;"His eyes are shining?"
96;388620;390370;"Or is that aura?"
97;390370;393370;"He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?"
98;393370;395120;"Let's give him another..."
99;395970;398120;"{\fad(176,1)}Ultrasonic Dissonance"
100;396120;398120;"Secret Noise!"
101;410860;411610;"Okay!"
102;412160;413970;"This should help some."
103;414280;418420;"He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever..."
104;419030;422890;"Water significantly weakens the power of sound!"
105;425390;427950;"Good, this is better..."
106;428640;431030;"I can locate the owl through its aura."
107;432860;433740;"Here it comes!"
108;435430;436240;"A feather?"
109;441540;442650;"Zetsu."
110;442650;445860;"Of course... They started off as wild animals."
111;445860;448100;"From birth, they've known 
to conceal themselves"
112;449470;451130;"when approaching their prey!"
113;451380;456160;"I can fend off their attacks, 
but the ultrasound really hurts."
114;456160;458020;"<i>If I don't keep up the</i> Gyo,"
115;458020;461640;"they'll take me down before 
I can even find them!"
116;462400;467320;"In terms of latent aura, 
the kid has a clear advantage."
117;467320;470150;"Even after being hit all those times, 
he's taken no damage."
118;470570;473920;"But his level of capability is irrelevant."
119;473920;476710;"Without a strategy, he's just a moving target."
120;477260;479190;"They work in perfect sync."
121;479540;481040;"I have to disrupt that!"
122;483970;488800;"Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top 
of me, we can't use ultrasound."
123;488950;490350;"Wrong guess!"
124;493070;495400;"If I use Rock, I can defeat this one."
125;495400;499770;"But then the bat might run 
and warn the other Ants!"
126;502740;506430;"To me, a starry night is as bright as day."
127;506430;508010;"As long as I'm not in total darkness,"
128;508010;513070;"I can see you without needing 
to rely on my hearing!"
129;513070;516160;"So if I cover my ears..."
130;516700;518580;"I can attack at will!"
131;521590;527620;"The kid has shrouded his entire 
body in aura to avoid damage."
132;527620;532770;"But that reduces the strength of his attacks, 
making it impossible to stand against them."
133;532770;536890;"At this rate, he'll never defeat them..."
134;537450;539600;"It's over for this kid."
135;539900;542610;"Their weakness is that"
136;542610;545850;"their movements are always in sync!"
137;549010;550110;"Here!"
138;552450;554790;"They always take positions on opposite sides"
139;554790;556850;"to avoid both being targeted at once."
140;558620;560660;"When the owl is in front of me,"
141;564280;566000;"the bat is directly behind me!"
142;569770;571250;"A giant wall?"
143;576750;578620;"The real wall was"
144;579480;581020;"behind me..."
145;589400;593030;"He turned our teamwork against us?"
146;598840;602280;"If I only have one opponent, 
I can concentrate on attacking."
147;602660;605590;"Once he pulls off one plan, 
things will go his way..."
148;605590;610380;"But that attack won't be enough 
to get him anywhere here."
149;611890;612850;"Damn!"
150;614800;617680;"First comes rock..."
151;618070;619900;"Rock... Paper..."
152;619900;621050;"Why, you..."
153;622470;625230;"Rock!"
154;627610;630190;"I made sure to knock you west!"
155;630520;632590;"Go back to NGL!"
156;633030;635710;"That was incredibly strong..."
157;635710;638700;"I see... This is his real ultimate attack."
158;638700;640580;"I take back what I said."
159;640580;641950;"This kid can be useful."
160;642280;644700;"But how do I proceed?"
161;646720;648210;"Diego has been dethroned."
162;649170;653840;"Brainwashed soldiers are running around, 
slaughtering entire villages and towns!"
163;654180;655900;"Diego has fallen?"
164;655900;657270;"Is that true?"
165;657270;661220;"But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone."
166;661490;663090;"There's no time to think about it!"
167;663090;665100;"Just leave this village and run, anywhere!"
168;665100;668740;"Warn people in other areas!"
169;670730;672970;"Who's interfering?"
170;673520;675020;"It was in the southeast this time."
171;675020;677200;"Some of my puppets have been stopped."
172;677660;678740;"That was fast."
173;679220;683680;"Whoever they are, they're keeping 
low and unpredictable."
174;683680;684820;"An assassin?"
175;685180;687750;"But they are acting on their own..."
176;688310;689460;"A decoy?"
177;690490;693290;"This is so annoying..."
178;693290;695380;"I wanna kill them!"
179;698420;701990;"It is no more than a diversion."
180;702580;703890;"Which means we cannot go."
181;704360;705900;"You think?"
182;705900;709140;"But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us."
183;709810;714900;"They're being careful not to let me catch them..."
184;715490;718540;"It may all be an act to draw you out."
185;719280;721070;"But perhaps I'm over-thinking things."
186;721520;722400;"But... But..."
187;723170;728660;"Ah, how I long to indulge myself 
in the delight of agonizing..."
188;729710;731690;"It is the sweet trap of the thought process."
189;732440;733850;"Nothing more."
190;735280;736620;"The answer is simple."
191;737440;739900;"Our mission is to protect the King."
192;740330;745160;"We can let the other Ants handle the rest."
193;749420;750930;"Is it our turn?"
194;751660;752810;"When we were injured"
195;752810;755710;"and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in."
196;755710;759640;"You even gave us instruction on using our power."
197;760710;764700;"It is time for us to return the favor!"
198;768320;771450;"Someone's running around 
and disabling my puppets."
199;771940;773090;"Can you kill them?"
200;773550;775040;"You can count on me."
201;775040;776960;"Take this cell phone."
202;777530;779960;"We can't use telepathy."
203;780440;783690;"I'll give you updates on their location."
204;784040;784990;"Understood."
205;790230;792980;"Can we really trust them?"
206;793250;796100;"Nah, I don't trust them."
207;796440;800020;"They're the ones trying to earn our trust,"
208;800020;802700;"so they'll try hard to carry out their mission."
209;803200;807610;"It's possible that they're looking for an 
opportunity to stab us in the back."
210;809250;814280;"In that case, we should treat them accordingly."
211;817570;821370;"The closest village is at two o'clock."
212;821370;823630;"The next closest villages are 
at eight and ten o'clock..."
213;824030;827630;"Should I skip them and head for 
Taba, forty kilometers away?"
214;830500;831390;"Play it safe..."
215;832160;834140;"Don't let anyone find me."
216;843650;845150;"I can't go this way."
217;860470;861770;"This is bad..."
218;861770;864180;"I should have taken matters into my own hands."
219;864790;866110;"What's wrong?"
220;866110;870470;"As we speak, Cheetu is racing 
toward East Gorteau."
221;871050;874090;"It seems the Hunters that replaced 
us failed to capture him."
222;874750;876950;"Is he headed toward us?"
223;876950;880690;"No, if he continues on his current 
course, he'll pass far to the south."
224;882230;883690;"Where are you going?"
225;884690;886430;"Don't try to stop me..."
226;886430;888950;"I'm already in a bad mood."
227;889490;893980;"The Hunter Association has captured three 
hundred and nineteen Chimera Ants"
228;893980;896170;"outside of NGL as of yesterday."
229;896580;901460;"But Colt confirmed that none of 
them were Squadron Leaders."
230;902280;903410;"According to him,"
231;903410;905950;"there are eight Squadron Leaders left 
that would be considered aggressive."
232;906530;911470;"Hunters have encountered four, 
but they all got away."
233;912170;916100;"Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason."
234;916100;918680;"He must know the King is here."
235;919340;924730;"He's choosing to return to the King's 
service in order to increase his power."
236;925420;930360;"My ability is still in effect, 
and I have more raw strength."
237;930360;934650;"But if we let him slip away and 
he gains even more power,"
238;934650;936740;"there's no telling who will win next time."
239;936740;941000;"If we allow more Ants like him to join the King,"
240;941510;944470;"we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away."
241;944780;947410;"Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?"
242;947780;950210;"If you are, I'll fight you first."
243;952760;955240;"First, we contact Morel-san."
244;956640;962270;"If worse comes to worst, 
he'll need to replace us."
245;962840;964270;"I'll come with you."
246;966400;969510;"This should increase the odds 
of capturing that Ant."
247;971790;974620;"It's Knuckle... Something's come up."
248;975080;977330;"Yes, I'd guess so."
249;977330;978030;"Probably."
250;978440;979470;"Yes."
251;979470;980290;"So, uh..."
252;980650;982550;"Hello? Hello?"
253;985230;986040;"Fools!"
254;987330;989820;"I told you to send Riakke!"
255;990200;992450;"He'd have been perfect for this."
256;993790;994910;"Huh?!"
257;994910;996800;"I don't give a damn!"
258;996800;998060;"What's wrong?"
259;998840;1001840;"The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped."
260;1002240;1006420;"The review board didn't send 
the Hunter we requested!"
261;1006820;1008840;"Who did they send?"
262;1008840;1010570;"Some Hunter I've never heard of."
263;1010990;1012340;"Probably an Association dog."
264;1012780;1013820;"An Association dog..."
265;1014560;1019590;"You mean Hunters who only take jobs 
through the Hunter Association."
266;1020200;1022330;"It isn't surprising that they have less talent."
267;1022780;1026810;"Damn! I should have gone 
to talk to Riakke myself!"
268;1027170;1029400;"Don't be foolish!"
269;1029740;1032830;"If you do anything without board approval,"
270;1032830;1035840;"the Chairman will get all the grief."
271;1036430;1042350;"He had to argue with the executive 
committee just to get the two of us here."
272;1043160;1046240;"But they don't understand the situation."
273;1046240;1050610;"They base it on past accomplishments 
and donations to the Association..."
274;1050610;1054890;"The review board has always been inflexible."
275;1055560;1058620;"How can you be so relaxed?!"
276;1059470;1062780;"If we underestimate the Squadron 
Leaders, we'll pay dearly for it."
277;1064420;1066090;"They're strong."
278;1066470;1069540;"After all, they listen to their deepest desires."
279;1070360;1073400;"So they have the talent to quickly master"
280;1073400;1076180;"the abilities they need the most."
281;1076540;1081510;"If we let the review board bring self-preservation 
and formality in, we won't get help in time."
282;1082710;1086060;"Maybe that's their goal..."
283;1086590;1090030;"You refer to the rumors that 
the Vice-Chairman's faction"
284;1090030;1092070;"controls the review board?"
285;1092620;1095410;"That they're only giving work to Hunters"
286;1095410;1100550;"who agree to vote for him in the next election?"
287;1101860;1104260;"There's no evidence of anything 
like that happening."
288;1105340;1107630;"You think they're stupid enough to get caught?"
289;1108100;1109850;"Look at the facts!"
290;1109850;1114480;"They've let every Squadron Leader 
they've faced escape alive!"
291;1116280;1122150;"If this expedition fails, 
the Chairman will shoulder the blame."
292;1122730;1126010;"They're willing to do whatever it 
takes to guarantee that result."
293;1126510;1128400;"As the Chimera Ants claim more victims,"
294;1128400;1131610;"the voices calling for the Chairman's 
resignation grow louder."
295;1132470;1136110;"Too bad the voices belong to a bunch 
of people sitting at their desks!"
296;1137830;1143190;"If we take out the King and five million 
people are already dead, we've failed!"
297;1144300;1147170;"We already knew that."
298;1147170;1149120;"The Chairman is prepared."
299;1149430;1153400;"When he developed this plan, he was 
well aware of the consequences."
300;1153890;1157520;"He knew how long assuring victory would take,"
301;1158030;1159630;"and the resulting casualties..."
302;1161400;1163640;"Five million is the low end..."
303;1164460;1166200;"That's too high!"
304;1172200;1173230;"Marcos-san?"
305;1174450;1175150;"What?"
306;1175540;1178150;"The phones have been ringing nonstop!"
307;1178820;1182910;"Rumors of a coup d'état are flying around."
308;1183440;1187150;"And it's been discovered that mass murders 
are taking place all over the nation."
309;1187150;1189860;"This is no rumor. It's actually happening!"
310;1189860;1191580;"What's going on here?"
311;1191580;1193670;"Are you responsible for this?"
312;1193990;1195790;"We haven't done anything!"
313;1196550;1198920;"The citizens have learned the 
truth about the selection?"
314;1200550;1202080;"We'll discuss this later."
315;1202520;1205090;"Return to the office before anyone suspects you."
316;1205090;1205920;"Morel!"
317;1206780;1212190;"Our beloved leader, Diego, has an 
urgent announcement to make."
318;1212550;1216940;"To ensure that our great leader's message 
will be heard throughout the nation,"
319;1216940;1221680;"we request that relay speakers in all 
regions be turned to maximum volume."
320;1221680;1227200;"All televisions and radios should be on, 
and the volume raised to maximum."
321;1228550;1231440;"Good evening, my beloved comrades."
322;1231830;1233070;"I am Diego."
323;1233580;1238800;"I have just declared that East 
Gorteau is under martial law."
324;1239340;1244220;"This precaution is being taken to combat 
malcontents that would foment rebellion."
325;1244470;1249260;"I ask all comrades to stay indoors, 
with your doors locked."
326;1250190;1254540;"Anyone outdoors without permission will 
be identified as a rebel and punished."
327;1254850;1259750;"I ask that you not lend an ear 
to false rumors being spread,"
328;1259750;1262210;"but that you follow my instructions."
329;1262210;1267680;"The soldiers of my special forces 
will be visiting your residences,"
330;1267680;1270240;"to see if any rebels are hiding inside."
331;1270610;1274250;"Do not open your doors for anyone else."
332;1274740;1276800;"Their response was too fast."
333;1276800;1278680;"It must be Killua and Gon."
334;1278680;1280290;"They weren't supposed to act."
335;1280910;1283870;"But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan."
336;1284440;1286510;"They were so well-prepared, 
I can't believe otherwise."
337;1287420;1290970;"The citizens learning the truth about 
the selection wasn't important."
338;1290970;1295330;"In fact, if they did, the military 
would have an excuse to mobilize."
339;1296390;1300770;"East Gorteau has been placed under martial law,"
340;1301470;1307620;"completely isolated from the rest of the world."
341;1312010;1314480;"Hmm... No problem."
342;1315060;1317400;"You can bring out tanks and fighter jets."
343;1318440;1320060;"I will stop them all."
344;1404380;1406900;"Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit."
345;1406900;1407840;"98!"
346;1407840;1408540;"99!"
347;1408540;1409270;"100!"
348;1409270;1410410;"We want to thank everyone..."
349;1410410;1411570;"...for helping us reach 100 episodes!"
350;1411570;1412420;"Thank you!"
351;1412420;1413760;"We hope you keep watching!"
