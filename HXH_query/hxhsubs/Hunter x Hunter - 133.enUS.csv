contest in order to buy time,"
2;9190;14050;"Pouf was now scattering scales on the 
citizens who were not yet hypnotized."
3;14890;19490;"I must hurry or Meruem-sama 
will remember that woman..."
4;22340;24590;"We haven't moved forward at all."
5;25010;28000;"What's going on up ahead?"
6;28000;30170;"Shh, no talking!"
7;30540;31990;"What are you talking about?"
8;31990;35430;"The soldiers are held up in the back."
9;36140;39480;"I heard all their commanders have 
collapsed, one after another..."
10;39480;41780;"Like puppets whose strings have been cut."
11;43270;47070;"There haven't been any warnings 
about stepping out of line anymore."
12;47970;50990;"I keep hearing loud noises 
coming from the palace..."
13;50990;52020;"Something is weird!"
14;52680;54020;"Maybe..."
15;54020;55200;"It's a coup d'état?"
16;67380;72700;"After giving the King 6/7 of my body,"
17;72700;74120;"I've lost a lot of my power."
18;75460;77520;"The scales aren't scattering well."
19;78230;81720;"And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets."
20;82860;86010;"Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,"
21;86010;90140;"Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?"
22;91630;95480;"The boy didn't look to be that strong."
23;96650;100250;"I cannot use my clones while 
I'm scattering my scales."
24;100760;104500;"But I need to hurry and kill the woman."
25;104970;106130;"Whatever it takes..."
26;106570;109740;"This is my final chance!"
27;190960;195960;"Deadline x To x Live"
28;204150;208020;"Palm, take the four women still here with you."
29;208020;210230;"They didn't run away?"
30;210560;211320;"No."
31;212060;214530;"Use duct tape to bind their 
hands and cover their eyes."
32;215060;217910;"If they see me, it'll take too long to explain."
33;218190;220490;"That's true... I understand."
34;221650;224590;"Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?"
35;233860;235130;"A messenger?"
36;235870;239650;"You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard"
37;240350;242600;"that the woman is in the underground warehouse."
38;243390;246140;"Let them know that we're looking to negotiate."
39;247850;249450;"Once that's done, you're free."
40;250100;252140;"It's probably a trap, right?"
41;252800;254650;"That's what I'll tell the King."
42;254650;257580;"If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me."
43;257980;258900;"Yeah."
44;259670;265260;"Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the 
enemy's bidding may anger the King."
45;265850;268010;"I'm not gonna dig my own grave."
46;272340;274920;"Fine, I'll try it."
47;275750;277030;"Can you drive?"
48;277730;279550;"Better than you."
49;285020;288430;"It's important that he carries out his mission."
50;288880;292350;"Perhaps I should keep an eye on him, 
even if it means losing Pouf..."
51;292350;293120;"Palm."
52;297470;298440;"It's okay."
53;303330;304300;"Welfin,"
54;304770;306520;"once this is over, you're free."
55;308720;310680;"Go and see Gyro."
56;317070;318780;"Don't get too cocky!"
57;318780;320340;"I'll kill you!"
58;320580;323250;"Don't you dare speak his name!"
59;323250;324840;"You would never understand!"
60;326680;329090;"I understand, Zaikahal."
61;338630;339780;"How..."
62;341410;343990;"How do you know"
63;345390;346640;"my former..."
64;348280;350350;"I didn't tell anyone."
65;351610;355650;"I probably won't ever remember my former name,"
66;356510;357870;"but we were buddies."
67;358930;360240;"Buddies?"
68;360730;361880;"Before we were Ants."
69;369330;370830;"They're our enemies."
70;372100;374560;"Enemies of NGL."
71;377550;378540;"Am I wrong?"
72;384370;386990;"Brovada has forgotten his past,"
73;387630;389110;"but he was also one of us."
74;389110;390320;"Take him with you."
75;401540;402640;"Ikalgo..."
76;403560;406490;"How do you know?"
77;407840;409010;"What do you mean?"
78;409810;412410;"You told me to go see Gyro."
79;413350;417020;"You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive."
80;417410;419350;"Yeah, that's true."
81;420140;421020;"But..."
82;421670;423270;"I don't know that he's alive."
83;423700;425520;"I just can't believe otherwise."
84;427390;430030;"Since we all "survived.""
85;430920;434030;"He couldn't have just been digested."
86;451990;454540;"Damn it... Damn it!"
87;456000;457810;"Damn it!"
88;472200;474960;"Are you sure about this, Pouf?"
89;475670;480140;"Ten minutes have passed, and I don't 
see any sign of Pitou returning..."
90;496240;497090;"Get out."
91;503730;506300;"Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape."
92;506920;510310;"Once you're outside, you'll understand 
the current situation."
93;531550;532760;"I hate to admit it..."
94;533870;535650;"But Ikalgo's right."
95;536450;539360;"Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him."
96;542180;544020;"Which means they're the enemy."
97;545390;547440;"I owe him for giving me a wake-up call."
98;547860;549880;"I'll be his messenger!"
99;570260;571290;"Stop!"
100;576560;578660;"Youpi-dono?"
101;580530;583520;"I already found a Royal Guard."
102;591820;592950;"Youpi-dono..."
103;593670;597820;"I have a message that must be 
taken to the King immediately."
104;607610;609090;"The underground warehouse?"
105;609090;609960;"Yes."
106;610610;612430;"And they're looking to exchange"
107;612430;616350;"the woman for their allies that 
have been taken hostage?"
108;617170;618280;"Yes."
109;618280;621280;"Please tell the King at once."
110;621860;624470;"Got it... I'm on it."
111;625360;626470;"Right..."
112;626470;630870;"We're having a contest, so I 
don't need to tell the King."
113;631680;637040;"If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one."
114;638850;640600;"You can go."
115;641010;642200;"Yes, sir."
116;642200;645580;"Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf."
117;650290;655010;"Still, what's Pitou doing right now?"
118;660070;661940;"Chimera Ants are the enemy."
119;667570;668650;"Gyro's enemy..."
120;669450;670580;"Our enemy!"
121;676480;677670;"Youpi-dono!"
122;679330;681050;"I have a question!"
123;681780;682700;"What is it?"
124;683350;685740;"Do you have any memories of your former life?"
125;686360;688700;"Memories from before you 
became a Chimera Ant?"
126;690390;691960;"No, of course not."
127;692480;695210;"I am the Royal Guard Youpi."
128;695940;697570;"I've never been anyone else."
129;698160;700470;"Don't ask me stupid questions!"
130;705130;706300;"Youpi-dono..."
131;706730;708560;"Hey! That's enough—"
132;715530;718500;"If you attack me, I'll fight back."
133;719340;721110;"I have a few questions for you."
134;721720;723560;"You have five seconds to answer."
135;731690;736230;"Don't get too cocky, you little punk!"
136;746450;747570;"Contest..."
137;752340;753410;"Contest..."
138;761810;764600;"Something is missing..."
139;779800;782050;"Marshal"
140;785360;791240;"{\fad(960,2878)}Marshal"
141;795310;799060;"Marshal"
142;800280;801700;"Yes..."
143;809950;810990;"I was"
144;811500;813700;"battling someone."
145;816090;817580;"Someone"
146;819940;822430;"that I have yet to defeat"
147;823770;826690;"a single time..."
148;855710;857760;"That took much longer than expected."
149;858230;860760;"By now, Pitou must have returned..."
150;861960;864010;"I hope the King hasn't grown impatient."
151;867920;868940;"Where's Youpi?"
152;870920;872560;"Where has Youpi gone?"
153;875020;876240;"What's that?"
154;888750;889840;"Youpi?"
155;896720;899540;"I-It can't be..."
156;913300;916200;"We're okay now..."
157;916950;919330;"What do you mean, Palm?"
158;923080;925530;"King! Meruem-sama!"
159;927810;929370;"Youpi has been killed."
160;929830;932570;"There are still skilled enemies around!"
161;933990;935330;"Where's Pitou?"
162;938000;940330;"Oh, Pitou hasn't returned..."
163;940920;942040;"Then..."
164;943010;945740;"I can now begin, yes?"
165;946200;948460;"W-Wait, Meruem-sama!"
166;948850;950340;"The situation has changed..."
167;950920;952750;"It's too dangerous! The contest is—"
168;952750;954250;"The contest is off?"
169;957640;959650;"That means I have won."
170;961450;963820;"Tell me everything you know."
171;966550;967990;"Is that acceptable?"
172;971050;973110;"We're okay now?"
173;973650;975460;"What do you mean, Palm?"
174;976360;981320;"Killua deduced that she is special to the King."
175;981770;985380;"But the Royal Guard is divided..."
176;986600;987900;"That is because"
177;989870;992880;"Pitou tried to save and protect her,"
178;994140;996150;"while Pouf tried to kill her."
179;999220;1001070;"In other words,"
180;1001820;1004560;"she is a double-edged sword for the King."
181;1005260;1006560;"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
182;1006920;1008550;"I find that hard to believe."
183;1009340;1011160;"It's impossible"
184;1011160;1014570;"for the Royal Guard to bicker 
and defy the King's will!"
185;1015040;1016140;"Is it?"
186;1016540;1020870;"Then why are you and I here now?"
187;1021310;1024080;"Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants"
188;1024080;1025750;"to side with humans?"
189;1027410;1029580;"Adding humans to the gene pool"
190;1029580;1033960;"has led to many events that would be 
impossible for normal Chimera Ants."
191;1033960;1036500;"Can you be certain that I'm wrong?"
192;1039420;1040650;"Sorry..."
193;1041010;1043020;"My point is that"
194;1043450;1047740;"the division among the Royal Guard 
may not necessarily contradict"
195;1047740;1050610;"their loyalty to the King."
196;1051370;1053880;"There is a human that the 
King cares deeply about."
197;1054520;1057010;""We must protect that human.""
198;1057010;1059090;""We must kill that human.""
199;1059090;1060620;"Both reactions make sense."
200;1062440;1065380;"For now, I'll concede that point to you."
201;1066510;1069560;"Why does that mean we're okay now?"
202;1071080;1074880;"Twenty minutes have passed 
since the initial wave of <i>En</i>."
203;1075370;1081180;"But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet."
204;1083920;1085810;"I don't get it..."
205;1085810;1087650;"What's going on here?"
206;1088250;1092800;"When the <i>En</i> was used, I was carrying this girl."
207;1093910;1096420;"If the King had noticed,"
208;1097310;1099660;"he would have come straight to me."
209;1100420;1103910;"He didn't because I had 
concealed her within my hair."
210;1104530;1108910;"It's possible that he didn't realize 
I was carrying another person."
211;1109660;1111130;"Are you following me?"
212;1112860;1115130;"It seems logical, so I can't argue that..."
213;1115490;1117680;"But I still don't see your point."
214;1118150;1124060;"If she's covered up, the King 
can't find her with his <i>En</i>."
215;1125660;1126880;"Are you suggesting"
216;1126880;1131190;"that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die, 
rather than make an exchange?"
217;1131660;1132770;"Of course not..."
218;1133220;1135330;"We'll offer to make an exchange."
219;1135970;1139640;"But we'll try to buy as much time as we can."
220;1140040;1143890;"To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place"
221;1143890;1145700;"where the King cannot find her."
222;1146230;1148920;"Buy time? How long are we talking?"
223;1150810;1153730;"Until the King dies."
224;1164280;1167990;"What is she talking about?"
225;1174320;1175940;"Until the King dies?"
226;1175940;1178120;"Sure, he has to die sometime..."
227;1178120;1181290;"But if we knew when he'd die, 
we wouldn't have a problem!"
228;1182500;1185140;"Why are we okay now?"
229;1185140;1187090;"Give me a proper explanation!"
230;1190440;1195000;"The King will die, and it will happen soon."
231;1201500;1203530;"Within the next few hours,"
232;1204750;1206350;"the King will die!"
233;1216810;1218280;"We need to go deeper..."
234;1219340;1223950;"Yes, we must put her in a place 
where only we can find her."
235;1235900;1237230;"That should do it."
236;1238420;1240810;"All that's left is to negotiate,"
237;1241580;1245380;"without going far enough to make the King snap."
238;1249770;1250790;"I know..."
239;1252780;1255250;"What we're doing is cruel."
240;1262680;1266210;"We are no different from them."
241;1266660;1267530;"No..."
242;1268770;1270330;"We are far worse!"
243;1290600;1293350;"Pitou... Pitou..."
244;1293930;1295310;"Where are you?"
245;1296190;1297940;"Pitou!"
246;1405050;1407680;"Next time: The Word x Is x That Someone."
247;1408570;1410030;"And it isn't "Killua.""
248;1410750;1413270;"And that's all there is to it."
