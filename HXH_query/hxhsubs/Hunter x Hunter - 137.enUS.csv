election of the next chairman."
54;209860;211270;"Hold on!"
55;211270;213690;"Why are you leading the meeting?"
56;213940;215940;"Huh? Is there a problem?"
57;216410;219440;"Don't boss us around after you showed up late."
58;219700;222760;"Pariston, you're irritating! 
You're a creep! Get lost!"
59;222760;226670;"Well, I wasn't sure if I should take the lead."
60;226670;229330;"But you know, I'm the Vice Chairman."
61;229820;233930;"I outrank the rest of you, and I'm 
good at coordinating these things."
62;233930;236650;"I'm sure you all want to finish this quickly."
63;236650;237960;"That's why."
64;238770;240960;"If we rank by age, Botobai-san should lead."
65;241500;244470;"Judging by ability to foster progress, 
Cheadle-san should lead."
66;244980;247820;"Both are better suited to the task than I."
67;247820;250470;"Would one of you be willing to take over?"
68;250840;253980;"I'll refrain. You'd probably give me a hard time."
69;257790;258980;"I concur."
70;260360;262670;"Forget it. Just lead the meeting."
71;262670;265240;"Just come out and say you 
want to do it, scumbag."
72;265830;270170;"In that case, if anyone objects 
to me leading this meeting,"
73;270170;271910;"raise your hand."
74;271910;274600;"I object! I object! I seriously object!"
75;275040;276640;"I see four objections..."
76;276640;279950;"The majority says I should continue."
77;279950;283870;"Of course, we can discuss any 
complaints as they arise."
78;283870;285920;"I'm ready to step down anytime."
79;288560;291020;"Then, I have a proposal."
80;291400;293890;"I will run for the position of chairman,"
81;294320;296270;"so let's not bother with an election."
82;299240;302620;"I'm gonna kill you, brat!"
83;303430;306210;"Scary... Everyone calm down."
84;306210;309530;"My point is that we'll waste time and money."
85;309530;311540;"We already know the results."
86;312010;315960;"No one here will vote for you."
87;316800;318290;"That's eleven votes."
88;319860;323340;"Together, you can only muster eleven votes."
89;323950;326800;"Do you know how many Hunters 
are in the Association?"
90;327780;330440;"The late Chairman Netero was too strong..."
91;330880;333930;"So he couldn't understand 
the feelings of the weak."
92;335220;337430;"The same can be said for all of you."
93;337920;340060;"However, I can understand the weak!"
94;341000;343320;"That is the kind of Chairman I seek to be!"
95;343880;348130;"The weak end up as your slaves, 
working under the name of intermediaries."
96;348130;352330;"How much have you made off 
them, Prince of Kickbacks?"
97;352790;356740;"Please, you have it wrong. I'm asking 
them to contribute to the pool."
98;356740;360330;"It's meant to help the Association expand."
99;361420;362530;"Eighteen people."
100;363000;365640;"Do you know what that number represents?"
101;367940;371010;"The number of Hunters who've 
gone missing in the three years"
102;371010;373630;"since you became Vice Chairman."
103;374610;376450;"As professionals who risk our lives,"
104;376450;380270;"we're obligated to be aware of the 
situations our trusted associates are in."
105;381010;385480;"A missing Hunter is more bizarre than 
a Hunter's unexpected death."
106;386760;391120;"Before you became Vice Chairman, the 
average was 0.6 Hunters missing per year."
107;391630;393240;"It's increased tenfold."
108;396250;397750;"Do you have anything to say?"
109;399900;403250;"That number is tragic... It pains me greatly."
110;404300;407310;"Once I become Chairman, 
the number will surely decrease!"
111;410920;412430;"I'll run for Chairman."
112;415500;417530;"I'm going to carry on the old man's will."
113;425480;429190;"Don't want to vote for either of them!"
114;429790;432820;"Ging-san, I hear something 
happened to your son..."
115;432820;433920;"Sounds like it."
116;433920;435890;"Should I visit him?"
117;435890;438210;"Sure, he'd probably be thrilled."
118;439970;441580;"Would he even realize I was there?"
119;441580;444230;"I heard he's in critical condition."
120;444230;446320;"Maybe I shouldn't go after all..."
121;446320;448810;"If he dies after I do, I'll have wasted my time."
122;450020;451080;"Go visit him."
123;451540;453340;"He isn't going to die."
124;458520;460570;"Uh, can I ask a question?"
125;460570;463980;"First, shouldn't we reevaluate 
the process for running?"
126;464990;467480;"You're the one who started it!"
127;467480;469490;"What's wrong with your head?!"
128;469960;474280;"I only offered to serve in hopes 
of saving us money and time."
129;474280;477620;"If we can't avoid the process, 
let's first decide how to go about it."
130;479250;480370;"There we go!"
131;481080;483380;"When he controls the pace,"
132;483380;486250;"everything becomes more complicated."
133;487200;489510;"In that case, we can draw lots."
134;490720;491960;"Screw that!"
135;491960;494260;"How can we have our leader chosen by chance?"
136;494960;496510;"Are you a scumbag, too?"
137;497390;499520;"I'll give a sheet of paper to each of you."
138;500110;501140;"Hey..."
139;501140;508060;"I want each of you to write what you believe to be the optimal election process,"
140;508060;511650;"with the prerequisite of achieving 
at least 95% voter turnout."
141;512170;516410;"And a third party will pick one 
of the proposals at random."
142;517160;518420;"A third party?"
143;518420;520910;"I'm guessing she means Beans."
144;523140;525330;"Each proposal has a 1 in 12 chance."
145;525330;527040;"So there won't be any hard feelings."
146;528250;529210;"That's true..."
147;529210;530830;"Not a bad idea."
148;530830;533170;"That's fine, since I won't lose."
149;533590;538310;"But we should write down our names, 
so we know whose idea is chosen."
150;541870;545480;"She said the odds are 1 in 12, but that isn't true."
151;545800;547980;"If the ten of us write something 
that puts Pariston..."
152;547980;549510;"and Ging, if possible..."
153;550030;555490;"at a disadvantage, our odds will be 5 in 6."
154;556880;560080;"If we record how each person votes,"
155;560080;561870;"Pariston will have an advantage."
156;562340;566480;"Should we use anonymous ballots to allow 
for dividing points among candidates?"
157;567120;570590;"Would our intermediaries then 
betray us with no guilt or fear?"
158;574990;577300;"So here we are, Beans-san."
159;577920;580650;"There are twelve sheets of paper inside."
160;581170;582660;"Please pick one."
161;583160;586310;"It will determine the rules 
we will use for the election."
162;587050;588210;"You want me to pick one?"
163;590840;593670;"This is an important task."
164;604490;606260;"Then I will draw one."
165;613130;616090;"The chosen proposal is Ging-san's."
166;634220;635730;"Ging's rules..."
167;636120;639990;"He's no Pariston, but he's still trouble."
168;642520;643890;"Rule #1."
169;644530;648500;""All Hunters are both candidates and voters.""
170;648850;650050;"Rule #2."
171;650660;657010;""If the winner of the first election fails 
to receive a majority of votes,"
172;657010;660120;"the top sixteen will have a runoff."
173;660120;664090;"If a majority is still not achieved, there will 
be another runoff with half the candidates.""
174;665380;666580;"Rule #3."
175;667190;672520;""If the turnout for any given vote is under 
95%, that vote must be redone.""
176;673090;674180;"Rule #4."
177;674850;679780;""Voters must write their name on the ballot. 
Anonymous votes will be invalid.""
178;682530;684450;"What are you thinking?!"
179;684450;685910;"Why force people to sign them?"
180;686140;689100;"Are you an idiot? A total idiot?!"
181;689100;690640;"You are the idiots."
182;692090;694690;"When everyone knows who voted for whom,"
183;694690;696670;"it's a lot more entertaining."
184;697020;698440;"There's his problem..."
185;698440;701560;"He only cares about having fun!"
186;703120;704370;"Rule #5."
187;704370;705550;"There's more?!"
188;706460;711440;""The election committee chairman 
will be Ging Freecss.""
189;712900;714600;"I didn't think of that!"
190;715410;716730;"I didn't include such a rule..."
191;717320;718650;"That was a mistake."
192;719030;721900;"I was too focused on the actual rules."
193;722560;725100;"This is what Ging really wanted."
194;725990;729930;"Now he can control the election as he pleases."
195;731470;733270;"May I say something?"
196;733270;736480;"This drawing was to determine how the 
election would be conducted, correct?"
197;736890;739070;"Rules one through four are fine,"
198;739070;741680;"but the chairman should be chosen separately."
199;742790;744460;"I can live with that."
200;745070;746430;"You can?"
201;747940;749600;"This is a Hunter."
202;754270;755640;"Frightening..."
203;757820;760320;"Two Days Ago"
204;761020;762110;"Ging-san!"
205;763490;764330;"Yo."
206;764760;767140;"What brings you here so early?"
207;767140;769200;"I'm surprised you actually came."
208;769540;772330;"Yeah, I happened to be in the area."
209;772830;774700;"That can't be true..."
210;775790;777280;"Thank you very much."
211;777810;779490;"I saw the old man's video."
212;781550;784220;"Oh, that pen and notepad..."
213;784220;785260;"Huh?"
214;785260;788510;"Can you leave one by the phone 
in the conference room?"
215;789610;792610;"Oh, there should already be one."
216;792610;794890;"Oh, never mind, then."
217;795650;797660;"Is there also a trashcan like this one?"
218;797660;798490;"Yes."
219;799750;802290;"Why do you ask?"
220;809470;810870;"Four..."
221;810870;813120;"No, eight."
222;815070;816260;"Read this."
223;818240;821110;"These are rules for the election, yes?"
224;821480;822450;"Yeah."
225;823130;824590;"What is this for?"
226;825410;828980;"In a few days, the Zodiacs will gather here."
227;829610;831570;"Most likely, there will be a drawing."
228;832570;834190;"Why would you say that?"
229;834190;838560;"If we tried to hold a vote or come to a 
consensus, it would take too long."
230;839090;841270;"Plus, Pariston will be there..."
231;842820;845430;"As far as he's concerned,"
232;845430;849510;"1 in 12 odds would be acceptable, 
as long as it might give him an advantage."
233;850060;852280;"Either way, it's a win for him."
234;853270;857300;"And everyone else will think 
their odds are 5 in 6..."
235;857820;859530;"That basically guarantees a drawing."
236;860680;863920;"I expect Cheadle will propose it."
237;863920;865450;"Saccho may protest."
238;865810;867140;"Piyon would be a long shot."
239;867570;869560;"Kanzai would be a really long shot..."
240;869560;872810;"And they'll ask me to hold the drawing?"
241;872810;874290;"There's no one else."
242;874790;877360;"Everyone else in this building supports Pariston."
243;878060;883410;"If these rules look acceptable, fold it three 
times, and keep it until the meeting."
244;884600;889180;"If they don't ask for you or if 
I fold my paper differently,"
245;889620;893230;"I'll look at the floor, and you should 
burn that piece of paper."
246;894790;899210;"In my opinion, if you're willing 
to become Chairman..."
247;899470;900910;"No, that won't happen."
248;901190;902360;"Zero chance."
249;902360;903380;"Sorry."
250;904130;906860;"I'm not doing this because I 
want to change the result."
251;908280;910770;"All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will."
252;911300;913350;"I'm not looking for any trouble."
253;914210;916860;"But what about Rule #5?"
254;916860;918380;"That's a decoy."
255;919780;923480;"If I leave that as Rule #5, it'll give people pause."
256;924470;926680;"And if I agree to concede that rule,"
257;926680;929110;"they'll be more ready to accept the rest."
258;929580;932170;"This is how criminals con people."
259;932170;933620;"It's nothing special."
260;934510;937150;"If Rule #5 passes, I'll resign."
261;937610;940500;"Ging-san, why do this if you don't want"
262;940500;942320;"to change the result?"
263;943910;946000;"That's a strange question to ask."
264;946890;949590;"If I can get my target to move as I want,"
265;949590;951630;"I've succeeded as a Hunter."
266;952720;955050;"I just want to enjoy the process."
267;955050;956420;"That's all."
268;965000;970150;"The election committee was composed 
of the twelve Zodiacs."
269;970590;976660;"Cluck, one of the Zodiacs, 
sent ballots to every Hunter."
270;982120;985250;"The election for the 13th Chairman..."
271;986170;989610;"The Hunter Association has 661 members."
272;990090;992930;"Which means that is the number of candidates."
273;993580;996420;"Each Hunter must bring their own ballot."
274;996420;1000350;"Ballots may only be entered when at least three"
275;1000350;1004650;"committee members are present, 
and identification has been verified."
276;1005530;1008820;"The voting takes place in the Hunter 
Association headquarters."
277;1009320;1013240;"As long as three or more 
committee members are present,"
278;1013240;1016210;"absentee ballots may be entered 
at a different location."
279;1017010;1019610;"The vote will take place"
280;1019610;1027010;"from 12:00 AM on August 8th 
to 11:59:59 PM on August 8th."
281;1027010;1028470;"This will not change."
282;1028470;1031640;"Any voting that occurs away from headquarters 
must follow this schedule."
283;1032270;1034300;"Votes will be tallied the same day."
284;1037890;1040970;"And it is now August 8th, 12:00 AM."
285;1041350;1042880;"The vote begins."
286;1068870;1070490;"May I put it in?"
287;1070490;1071750;"This is a surprise."
288;1072120;1073110;"I wouldn't think"
289;1073110;1077310;"a murderer would be interested 
in such an ordinary event."
290;1079270;1081140;"Eighty-five points."
291;1081740;1083760;"Yes, I'm not interested."
292;1084060;1085770;"See? It's blank."
293;1087480;1089900;"Then why are you here?"
294;1091800;1093280;"Ninety points..."
295;1094210;1095520;"Is someone named Ging here?"
296;1095890;1097930;"I'd like to speak to him."
297;1098300;1100530;"He's already gone..."
298;1100750;1104260;"He said the next time we see 
him here will be at the runoff."
299;1104670;1107510;"Why don't you take your paper and leave?"
300;1109150;1111170;"Seventy-seven points."

306;1145780;1149850;"Ten points, twenty points, forty-five points."
307;1149850;1155210;"Ten points, two points, fifty points, thirty points."
308;1157310;1160920;"I guess pro Hunters are still nothing special..."
309;1161360;1165970;"If I want someone to fight, 
it'll have to be a Zodiac."
310;1167810;1169250;"Ninety-five points!"

the mutant Ants he was fighting,"

chairman or the Ants."
