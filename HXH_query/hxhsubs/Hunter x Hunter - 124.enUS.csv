1;4070;7480;"Approximately thirty minutes after 
the Hunters entered the palace..."
2;9000;12650;"As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace,"
3;13450;18060;"an immense number of citizens 
hypnotized by Pouf's wing scales"
4;18550;24600;"still waited outside for the selection process 
that would turn them into soldier ants."
5;27790;33530;"Meanwhile, a creature in the form that 
they would soon become began to stir."
6;136990;142030;"Breakdown x And x Awakening"
7;160240;162550;"Okay, all charged up."
8;194000;195030;"Someone's watching me."
9;196350;197250;"And..."
10;199310;201910;"It's probably someone I know."
11;241810;243010;"No one's there?"
12;284420;286530;"While her appearance hadn't totally changed,"
13;286780;290060;"Palm was clearly no longer the same person."
14;290800;294230;"And that greatly disturbed Killua."
15;298620;300240;"She was captured"
16;301500;303070;"by the Royal Guard..."
17;304190;306070;"And she's been transformed!"
18;307260;310740;"If Gon sees what's happened to Palm,"
19;311370;312710;"he won't be able to take it..."
20;314230;319570;"There's no room left in his heart."
21;320410;325090;"If the transformation has 
reached as far as Palm's heart..."
22;329340;331510;"I can see Gon completely breaking down!"
23;336060;339610;"I must learn the answer."
24;344540;345790;"We still have a chance."
25;346250;347830;"Palm approached me herself!"
26;350850;351870;"Palm?"
27;353220;355570;"Palm must have sensed me"
28;355570;359000;"before I noticed her watching me..."
29;360440;363020;"Using that power she told us about before."
30;365250;369080;"Once I used my power, it was quite simple."
31;370890;374780;"I thought she could use some kind 
of divination to locate people."
32;375470;377890;"But it's probably closer to clairvoyance."
33;379560;383980;"From her position, Palm shouldn't 
have been able to see me..."
34;385190;389250;"The only conclusion is that she was 
watching me by some other means."
35;391380;395290;"And if Palm were an enemy, 
she would have backed off..."
36;396710;399910;"Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance."
37;400340;403550;"And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't 
remember me anymore."
38;404080;405780;"Since she approached me,"
39;407980;409300;"she must remember me..."
40;410950;412510;"Remember us!"
41;416030;418320;"Killua, yes?"
42;421800;423090;"I knew it..."
43;425290;426510;"She has her memories!"
44;429140;430230;"Where's Gon?"
45;432510;436950;"Once he's seen what I've 
become, will Gon hate me?"
46;439810;442610;"Gon doesn't judge people by appearances."
47;443180;447090;"And you're assuming that he 
doesn't already hate you."
48;448220;451970;"You're always so spiteful..."
49;453640;455350;"Well, it doesn't matter."
50;455920;460990;"I have nothing to gain from your pity."
51;462500;464000;"Where's Gon?"
52;465290;467280;"Gon's with Pitou."
53;467700;468660;"He's—"
54;473260;474740;"Why can she see me,"
55;476420;478510;"but she can't see Gon?"
56;482420;483750;"What's wrong?"
57;486790;489250;"Was it chance that you happened to find me?"
58;489990;492440;"Huh? What are you talking about?"
59;492910;496010;"You're the one who turned the corner."
60;496540;500150;"Wrong! I sensed you watching me."
61;500670;502480;"That's why I came this way!"
62;504040;506260;"You noticed me first."
63;508290;509760;"Why are you lying?"
64;513760;515780;"Troublesome brat..."
65;516670;518390;"Where's Gon?"
66;518390;520400;"Answer my question first."
67;523500;528290;"Did I notice Palm watching me 
only when she physically saw me?"
68;529350;534200;"Does that mean Palm actually 
saw me once, then immediately left?"
69;534960;538510;"Then she used clairvoyance 
to watch me follow her,"
70;538510;541770;"and turned around so it'd look 
like she was approaching me?"
71;546210;547550;"For the last time..."
72;550360;551940;"Where's Gon?"
73;556800;558230;"I won't tell you."
74;559180;561200;"You're an enemy, aren't you?"
75;577790;581200;"I made a mistake..."
76;582520;585100;"I used my power incorrectly."
77;585800;588960;"When I was brimming with rage,"
78;591020;594610;"I should have let my emotions take over!"
79;600160;602620;"{\fad(482,1)}Black Widow
Dark Demon Goddess"
80;603930;606600;"Sh-She's dangerous!"
81;607830;611380;"Better to let everything out than hold it in."
82;613540;617670;"That includes my desire to kill you!"
83;639260;641620;"Well? What now?"
84;644270;645910;"Will you die without a word?"
85;646640;648500;"Will you die after speaking?"
86;665160;668660;"Or will you just die?"
87;686350;690810;"Palm's ability to arm herself by covering 
her body with her hair, Black Widow,"
88;690810;693830;"varied in appearance according
to her emotional state."
89;694070;697510;"But defense was its primary function."
90;699980;701840;"What made Black Widow frightening"
91;702960;707980;"was the fact that she could rely on 
her hair armor for protection,"
92;708470;711600;"allowing her to devote all 
her energy to her attacks."
93;727010;729370;"<i>P-Palm-san! Turn off your </i>Hatsu!"
94;731490;733550;"Palm is an Enhancer."
95;734130;737880;"When everything clicks, it's possible 
to become this much stronger?"
96;739150;741930;"I completely blocked the attack, 
but I still took damage."
97;743460;747010;"If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage."
98;747750;750560;"But I can't run away."
99;751730;754990;"Gon's mind is already at its limit!"
100;755420;759010;"He's barely holding himself together, 
while he waits for Pitou."
101;767320;769030;"I can't let them meet."
102;770070;773120;"Even if Palm's heart is still there..."
103;777060;778510;"It'll have a negative effect now!"
104;795610;796600;"Palm!"
105;798250;800420;"Why are you looking for Gon?"
106;800420;803570;"Depending on why, I might be 
willing to tell you where he is."
107;804350;807310;"Huh? Why are you asking now?"
108;807700;809550;"There's no reason..."
109;809550;810910;"I just want to see him."
110;811690;813820;"He's probably nearby."
111;813820;815660;"I'll find him myself."
112;816340;818660;"Once I've killed you!"
113;826670;827340;"Sorry!"
114;830450;833820;"I panicked and called you an enemy..."
115;833820;836730;"But even if you look different, 
you're still Palm, right?"
116;839240;840910;"Gon is suffering."
117;841200;843880;"Someone he deeply respects 
was completely transformed."
118;844450;847390;"That person had his soul taken away."
119;847930;851240;"Right now, Gon is facing off 
against the one responsible!"
120;852040;855970;"If you appear before Gon 
looking as you do now..."
121;861480;862960;"Gon will..."
122;864660;866510;"totally snap."
123;873510;875180;"So you have to"
124;876450;880170;"call him by his name first."
125;882630;884290;"You must say, "Gon.""
126;890060;893100;"That's the condition."
127;896250;897730;"Tell him you're okay."
128;905010;907620;"Before we entered the palace,"
129;908880;911050;"Gon was really worried about you."
130;916310;919930;"Give him some peace of mind..."
131;924170;925570;"He was just buying time."
132;926090;928270;"He had no intention of letting them meet."
133;928670;930260;"That was the idea..."
134;936940;937990;"Help..."
135;939410;943530;"make him feel a little better, if you can..."
136;944700;949430;"Only you can do that now!"
137;954740;957640;"No one else..."
138;959510;960830;"can do it."
139;966140;967270;"I can't..."
140;969950;972910;"do anything!"
141;982800;984380;"Once he'd said those words,"
142;985530;989420;"the dam within him burst."
143;1004660;1005770;"He's completely defenseless."
144;1006480;1007930;"Change in plans..."
145;1007930;1010030;"Kill him now, #1!"
146;1017320;1021410;"When Palm had infiltrated the palace,"
147;1021410;1025710;"arriving at the exit Knov had 
placed near the stairway,"
148;1026100;1028100;"Pitou's <i>En</i> returned."
149;1029160;1036300;"Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt 
as though she'd be crushed to dust,"
150;1036870;1039510;"she reached the same conclusion Knov had."
151;1041470;1048060;"As she watched Pouf slowly and silently 
descend the stairs, she made her decision."
152;1049090;1050870;"She plotted to take her own life,"
153;1050870;1055010;"so she would look like a despairing girl 
who could not bear Bizeff violating her."
154;1057010;1060080;"However, Pitou prevented that from happening."
155;1061220;1066550;"As one cannot help but shiver in the cold,"
156;1066550;1069470;"no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura"
157;1069470;1074090;"to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura 
at the moment she was exposed to it."
158;1074800;1077180;"The Royal Guard was interested in her aura,"
159;1077180;1079970;"and after receiving permission from the fasting King,"
160;1080390;1086010;"Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1."
161;1087440;1089850;"Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered"
162;1089850;1092520;"their pasts had stronger mental fortitude."
163;1093720;1099830;"This was most noticeable in Ants who 
had learned how to use <i>Nen</i>."
164;1100210;1105690;"Memories of the past tended to both assist 
and deter the growth of soldiers."
165;1106630;1109550;"Deterrence generally happened"
166;1109550;1112900;"when memories led to emotional reactions."
167;1113710;1119100;"Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded 
that they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe"
168;1119100;1123330;"to destroy the connection between 
Palm's memories and her emotions."
169;1124610;1129140;"The experiments that produced Cheetu 
and Leol confirmed that those"
170;1129140;1133640;"who retained more of their memories 
emerged from their cocoons sooner."
171;1135050;1139440;"To quickly and quietly conquer humanity,"
172;1139440;1143680;"leaving soldiers with their memories, while 
keeping control of them, would be best."
173;1145020;1148330;"Palm was the perfect test subject."
174;1151240;1155660;"The success of her experiment would 
signify the end of the human race."
175;1156590;1158470;"Now go, #1..."
176;1159070;1161910;"Beat the kid before you to death!"
177;1161910;1163000;"Shut up."
178;1168590;1169970;"I am"
179;1171040;1172880;"Palm Siberia."
180;1177410;1179240;"I'm not #1!"
181;1187650;1192500;"I will never become a pawn to you Ants..."
182;1194330;1196310;"Even if it costs my life!"
183;1218030;1219180;"Killua..."
184;1220650;1222240;"I have you to thank."
185;1224710;1227350;"There was a wall inside my head."
186;1228240;1230860;"My emotions were separated from my body."
187;1231580;1233320;"I couldn't do anything about it."
188;1234570;1237100;"I've been like this since I woke up."
189;1238710;1241280;"You removed the barrier."
190;1242580;1245170;"Don't say that there's nothing you can do."
191;1250420;1255110;"If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to."
192;1257080;1258660;"But you must not forget..."
193;1260810;1265110;"You are the one Gon needs most."
194;1283320;1284470;"What is it?"
195;1285170;1286420;"Failure."
196;1286950;1288570;"That's all there is to it."
197;1290870;1292710;"Slow and steady it is."
198;1293350;1297470;"Soldiers do not need memories or emotions..."
199;1298830;1302740;"Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power."
200;1303760;1308240;"I can create soldiers on my own!"
201;1310390;1315260;"That will make it easier 
to build a new kingdom"
202;1316680;1319740;"for the King and me."
203;1404730;1407620;"Next time: Great Power x And x Ultimate Power"
204;1407620;1410580;"Oh, Knuckle... You're lending me this manga?"
205;1410580;1413010;"Wait, this is mine."
206;1413010;1414590;"Oh, well."
