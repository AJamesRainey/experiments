1;3150;4290;"Killua..."
2;5830;7510;"I have you to thank."
3;9430;11970;"I've been like this since I woke up."
4;13130;15590;"Don't say that there's nothing you can do."
5;21120;25880;"If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to."
6;27730;29420;"But you must not forget..."
7;31450;35850;"You are the one Gon needs most."
8;123970;129020;"Great Power x And x Ultimate Power"
9;131750;134400;"Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon"
10;134400;137870;"miraculously returned Palm to her old self."
11;140560;142990;"Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,"
12;143450;146270;"Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings,"
13;146750;150190;"appearing before those in the room"
14;150190;153410;"in order to challenge Pouf."
15;157810;158860;"Pouf..."
16;171190;172770;"Step outside."
17;179220;180380;"Very well."
18;181100;182500;"I will face you."
19;183480;187290;"But first, I have something to say."
20;189750;192540;"That which stands before you is only a clone."
21;193510;197050;"My true body is already on its way to the King."
22;206570;210890;"Having escaped the cage of smoke,"
23;211240;215560;"Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle 
and Morel had made contact."
24;215960;217740;"He decided to assume"
25;217740;220990;"that his enemies knew of 
his ability to create clones,"
26;220990;222660;"and to act accordingly."
27;222910;224590;"That was the correct call."
28;225950;228780;"The boss told me that you could make clones."
29;229560;230660;"You're telling the truth."
30;234120;238250;"Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake."
31;239430;244180;"By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted 
to gain the mental advantage."
32;245580;247920;"His plan was a success."
33;250370;253290;"But why are you telling me this?"
34;254840;257470;"Pouf's concern was Youpi."
35;258860;260690;"Since Knuckle was here,"
36;261150;264390;"that meant that Youpi had spared his life"
37;264390;266770;"and had not told Pouf this."
38;269980;271830;"Depending on his reason..."
39;275880;277260;"Answer me!"
40;281870;284050;"To satisfy him."
41;290870;296310;"Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully 
so that he could persuade Knuckle"
42;296720;300160;"to tell him the motive behind the 
transformation he'd sensed in Youpi."
43;301620;305070;"I told you in order to satisfy him."
44;306100;310340;"He has demanded that I not leave this room."
45;311010;313050;"If we are to engage in a duel,"
46;313050;317530;"I will need him to withdraw his 
demand, so that I may leave."
47;319840;321720;"I am but a clone..."
48;322480;324200;"I cannot use my wing scales."
49;325030;327760;"However, I am still willing to fight you."
50;329430;332270;"What I seek is a discussion."
51;332710;334840;"That is why I revealed the truth."
52;336840;342360;"Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who 
would call him from behind to challenge him,"
53;343190;348220;"appearing to be telling the truth 
would be more effective."
54;352880;353870;"You're lying..."
55;357540;361380;"You were going to kill me from behind."
56;365480;367310;"You even admitted it."
57;368170;370390;"Knuckle, don't let him fool you!"
58;373320;376950;"First, you claim to be a clone."
59;377820;379900;"Are you able to prove that?"
60;381910;382900;"He's right."
61;392130;394910;"This boy is proving troublesome."
62;397070;403040;"I dare say that, of our enemies, 
he possesses the strongest will."
63;406320;410770;"Perhaps I should be pleased"
64;410770;413930;"that he is trapped here with Pitou."
65;414970;420420;"Because his strong will keeps him in here."
66;425260;431070;"Were I to prove myself a clone, I would 
be placing myself at a disadvantage."
67;431360;432740;"So I can say nothing."
68;434030;437080;"You must use your own judgment."
69;437420;438680;"And..."
70;442030;444280;"I shall allow you"
71;446500;448960;"to decide what happens next."
72;450280;452720;"Pouf, you can't mean to..."
73;458840;459980;"Stop..."
74;493840;496510;"I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes."
75;496510;499150;"Whether you come or not is your choice!"
76;504100;505270;"Please wait..."
77;505710;507290;"I'm still here!"
78;507720;509390;"I apologize for Pouf's behavior!"
79;509970;511610;"I'm the only one you need, right?"
80;517890;518780;"Ten minutes."
81;521210;525290;"You have ten fewer minutes to heal her."
82;531970;534300;"Pitou was trembling."
83;535170;537970;"It was disturbing enough that"
84;537970;542470;"Pouf had been willing to leave, 
despite the consequences."
85;543070;547230;"But what was truly frightening was 
how Gon ignored Pouf's taunts,"
86;547230;550680;"calmly moving up the deadline instead."
87;555720;556840;"How long?"
88;557530;558820;"How long do I have to wait?"
89;561620;563830;"To completely heal her"
90;564510;566580;"will take three to four hours."
91;567200;568830;"No, I can't wait that long."
92;571730;573840;"If I have an hour,"
93;574870;578090;"I can heal her most critical injuries."
94;579500;584130;"Originally, to protect Komugi 
and heal her completely,"
95;584130;588840;"Pitou had deliberately named a longer 
time frame than was necessary,"
96;588840;590860;"which Gon had denied."
97;591190;594400;"So the hour that they'd agreed 
upon was the actual time"
98;594400;600370;"Pitou believed necessary for Komugi 
to make a full recovery."
99;601840;602900;"However,"
100;603590;608960;"Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time."
101;610780;612260;"It may have been possible"
102;612260;614990;"to speed up the treatment by ten minutes."
103;615390;617770;"Upon thinking this, Pitou realized..."
104;619060;620750;"It may have been mere coincidence,"
105;621270;626500;"but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten 
minutes to conform with Pouf's parting words."
106;628090;633490;"Despite that likelihood, Pitou 
could not shake a bad feeling."
107;635590;637310;"I must risk my life."
108;638650;640660;"Or else his fangs"
109;643980;647160;"may reach the King's throat!"
110;650700;651790;"I understand."
111;653590;654470;"Knuckle."
112;655870;658360;"I'll be fine here alone."
113;659310;661050;"I said that Pouf was lying,"
114;661390;666610;"but it's probably true that his main 
body is headed for the King."
115;668850;671060;"The King is to the south."
116;679040;683570;"Gon and Killua had seen everything 
that had transpired."
117;684850;686880;"But since Pitou did not know that,"
118;686880;690870;"it was only natural to assume that Gon"
119;690870;693580;"had seen through Pouf's plans."
120;694230;698780;"Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed."
121;699700;704300;"Pitou was now fully resolved to 
complete the mission at hand."
122;715370;717290;"I must kill him."
123;718500;720110;"No matter the cost!"
124;720700;721890;"I must kill him..."
125;723220;724670;"For the King's sake!"
126;726750;728860;"Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?"
127;729300;730460;"No, that won't work."
128;730850;732750;"I can't expose her to danger."
129;735630;739060;"First, I must entrust her to someone else."
130;739920;743430;"Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi."
131;744830;746110;"This won't do."
132;746630;751130;"If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?"
133;753510;754400;"Gon,"
134;754990;757550;"I understand what you're saying."
135;758120;759290;"However..."
136;759950;762110;"I will still do things my way."
137;766750;767620;"Youpi is..."
138;777500;779960;"No, never mind."
139;781540;785970;"If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant,"
140;786640;789880;"it could result in his death."
141;791200;792340;"See ya."
142;795230;798830;"Knuckle managed to stop himself."
143;814290;817450;"How would you know my name?"
144;823630;828050;"My subordinates were present at the 
moment of your mother's passing."
145;830710;834330;"She uttered your name with her dying breath."
146;835550;840540;"And my subordinates may have died 
fighting your Royal Guard by now."
147;847320;849680;"Interested in fighting me now?"
148;853160;856850;"If you can force me to admit defeat,"
149;856850;859290;"I will tell you your name."
150;862020;866480;"Force you to admit defeat without killing you?"
151;871110;873910;"So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap..."
152;883790;885070;"No matter."
153;885070;887280;"I shall checkmate you shortly."
154;902920;904920;"As the King moved into his stance,"
155;905420;907030;"Netero took to the air."
156;941350;942960;"When was it..."
157;947850;951480;"that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?"
158;954360;956000;"Whenever you're ready,"
159;957250;958220;"come at me."
160;1001540;1003270;"100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva..."
161;1001600;1005770;"{\fad(1,474)}100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva"
162;1018450;1023960;"{\fad(277,646)}Ninety-ninth Hand"
163;1020060;1022160;"Ninety-ninth Hand!"
164;1062670;1065440;"When was it"
165;1070340;1074020;"that I stopped hesitating to be gracious,"
166;1074940;1077510;"taking the hands of vanquished opponents"
167;1078750;1083300;"when they bowed their heads in defeat?"
168;1085970;1087970;"That cannot be"
169;1088710;1091590;"the ultimate power I sought!"
170;1106580;1108670;"It is fighting with all my soul against"
171;1109340;1111980;"an opponent with the strength to defeat me!"
172;1195120;1197010;"This is a tomb."
173;1201820;1203380;"Your tomb."
174;1291840;1293610;"I am very thankful."
175;1302420;1304460;"Thankful for everything"
176;1305390;1307760;"that has made our meeting possible!"
177;1404770;1406920;"Next time: Zero x And x Rose."
178;1407210;1409120;"We haven't seen each other in a while."
179;1409120;1409800;"Yeah."
180;1409800;1411830;"But it feels like you were always with me."
181;1411830;1412800;"Yeah."
182;1412800;1414630;"The future is ours."
