1;3730;7720;"There are six distinct categories of <i>Nen</i> users."
2;8770;10110;"Enhancer."
3;10110;15030;"Enhancers are able to strengthen 
various objects' effectiveness."
4;15780;16960;"Transmuter."
5;16960;20740;"Transmuters can use their aura 
to alter objects' qualities."
6;21830;23220;"Conjurer."
7;23220;27840;"Somewhat akin to Transmuters, 
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura."
8;28810;30140;"Emitter."
9;30140;33460;"Emitters can propel their 
aura like projectiles."
10;34470;35860;"Manipulator."
11;35860;39440;"Manipulators can use their auras to 
control objects and creatures."
12;40290;41750;"Specialist."
13;41750;45690;"Specialists are those with rare abilities 
that don't fit in the other five classes."
14;46800;49720;"Begin by determining which 
category your aura falls within."
15;49720;55030;"That is the first step to 
becoming a skilled <i>Nen</i> user."
16;136080;139830;"There's one month before the auction begins."
17;139830;143600;"Before then, you must find one item 
from the list we will provide,"
18;143600;146040;"and bring it here."
19;152970;156560;"If you are successful, you will be hired,"
20;156560;159020;"and begin training as a 
bodyguard and a collector."
21;159980;164270;"The man talking was, most likely, 
not the actual employer."
22;164690;167990;"That only illustrates the distance 
between the boss and me..."
23;169230;172290;"I shall reduce that distance to zero,"
24;172290;176590;"until the employer feels that he 
can trust me with his secrets..."
25;178020;179860;"I will pass this test."
26;180250;184070;"First I need to curry their favor, 
and win their trust."
27;184070;189080;"Nen x Users x Unite?"
28;189500;191410;"Hmm? The door won't open."
29;193100;194840;"I forgot to mention one thing."
30;195380;198430;"The barest minimum requirement 
is that you be strong..."
31;199430;203990;"Strong enough to leave this mansion alive."

The Guiding Ring Finger Chain"
33;252600;254020;"That's impressive."
34;254020;255940;"He used a chain to catch the bullets?"
35;271200;272540;"Three with guns."
36;273440;274480;"Six with swords."
37;279360;281300;"Two more with swords above."
38;284620;287030;"You guys did a good job 
of concealing your presences,"
39;287030;289350;"but you're too weak."
40;291420;294930;"I don't even need to use my <i>Nen</i>..."
41;298820;300360;"Now I understand."
42;300360;302650;"So that's what's going on."
43;315980;316670;"He's the one."
44;324040;325200;"Stop them."
45;326180;327530;"I'll give you three seconds."
46;328020;329040;"One..."
47;329040;329680;"Two..."
48;329680;331290;"Okay."
49;331760;333310;"I get it."
50;338410;340080;"Wh-What's going on?"
51;340600;342440;"They really were made from <i>Nen</i>."
52;342720;345150;"I could tell when I landed a punch,"
53;345150;348440;"that I was hitting aura shaped like a human..."
54;348880;349530;"However,"
55;349530;352170;"I didn't realize it was his <i>Nen</i>."
56;352170;354310;"How did you know?"
57;354310;357580;"You were always careful to stand 
next to others for camouflage."
58;357580;360290;"But when I observed from above, 
everything was clear."
59;361170;364420;"You were the only person not under attack."
60;367840;369960;"I realized something was wrong"
61;369960;372430;"when assailants appeared on the second floor."
62;372800;376100;"After I jumped on the chandelier,"
63;376100;378590;"they just stood there, swords swinging"
64;378590;381730;"in a futile attempt to reach me."
65;382910;385280;"I assume they received the following order:"
66;385930;388480;"Attack the nearest enemy."
67;389380;391870;"The assailants were given 
simple instructions,"
68;392070;393740;"so their attacks were also simple."
69;394280;397120;"However, it would take a skilled <i>Nen</i> user"
70;397120;401420;"to control eleven human-sized 
auras simultaneously."
71;402920;407210;"A <i>Nen</i> user who would most 
likely be a Manipulator."
72;407750;409900;"Given the size of auras involved,"
73;409900;412720;"the Manipulator had to be 
within a few meters."
74;413460;415430;"Which meant that the <i>Nen</i> user"
75;416380;418930;"was inside this room."
76;422400;423440;"You nailed it."
77;424440;426840;"My name is Shachmono Tocino."
78;427360;429620;"I'm actually a Hunter."
79;429620;431890;"I work for the boss here,"
80;431890;434740;"so I will have seniority over you."
81;434740;437610;"Now that everything's clear, 
could you drop the knife?"
82;445870;450840;"Judging by those chains, 
you must be a Manipulator..."
83;452540;455120;"Well, I hope you won't hold a grudge."
84;455120;457940;"I was just following orders from the boss."
85;458290;460710;""Test them by trying to kill them.""
86;461120;464480;"But I never expected you to 
pick up on me so fast."
87;465050;467500;"Well, the four of you together"
88;467500;469680;"should be able to escape this mansion."
89;469680;470860;"Good luck."
90;471210;472360;"Four?"
91;473260;476300;"Is there another plant in the room?"
92;481450;483620;"I'll assume that was meant as a diversion."
93;483620;485500;"But either way, it was a mistake."
94;486340;489170;"I shall determine if there 
are any other plants,"
95;489170;493180;"before we all start becoming paranoid."
96;535370;536430;"There."
97;539690;541460;"You are a plant."
98;551790;553420;"Th-That's ridiculous!"
99;553420;555150;"What makes you say that?"
100;555670;557910;"Your chain just started swinging."
101;558250;560030;"That is dowsing."
102;560030;562410;"Huh? What's that?"
103;562950;565040;"Dowsing was originally"
104;565040;569000;"a technique for locating water 
or metals underground."
105;569740;572380;"But it was also used in divination."
106;572930;577180;"I've heard of the technique being 
employed as a lie detector."
107;577530;579020;"That still doesn't"
108;579020;583180;"provide concrete proof that I'm a plant."
109;583700;585770;"He's probably right."
110;586570;591440;"Your heart began to pound as 
soon as he pointed at you."
111;592940;594620;"If you were innocent,"
112;595520;598660;"your heart rate would have slowly increased,"
113;599800;602800;"due to the stress of being wrongly accused."
114;603930;607330;"But your heartbeat immediately sped up,"
115;607330;610570;"before gradually slowing down."
116;612340;615420;"The typical melody of a liar..."
117;616280;618010;"Coming from both of you."
118;620510;621790;"I'm convinced."
119;623270;625180;"Both of them accuse you."
120;625570;628110;"That's two of the remaining five."
121;628110;630300;"Wait! Hold on!"
122;630300;632150;"That doesn't make it true."
123;632560;633530;"It's possible"
124;633530;638080;"that three out of five are 
applicants and two are fakes."
125;638080;639070;"I can confirm"
126;639070;641580;"that he is not a plant."
127;641580;642960;"Excuse me?"
128;642960;644790;"I think you meant "she," not "he.""
129;645940;647710;"And it appears that you 
are not a plant, either."
130;647710;651770;"My point is that we can't trust you!"
131;651770;655010;"You two could be working together."
132;660270;663400;"A-Anyway, this is a waste of time."
133;663400;666970;"We won't get anywhere by standing around."
134;668540;672730;"No other choice, then.
I will have to settle this
matter on my own."
135;683810;688000;""Everything that comes 
into contact with my fist 
will completely burn.""
136;688000;689120;"Huh?"
137;692980;694210;"This is my special power..."
138;694840;696750;"Great Haikuist!"
139;696960;700010;"Great Haikuist
Wandering Haiku Poet"
140;709840;714060;"Damn it all to hell.
It didn't burn very well.
That was a failure."
141;717830;720240;"That was a haiku,"
142;720240;722510;"the prized literary art of my homeland."
143;723250;726240;"When I read a haiku, it happens."
144;728930;730720;"There's your explanation."
145;730720;732610;"Back to the subject at hand."
146;737420;741940;""Any person who 
responds untruthfully to 
my question will burn.""
147;743080;747850;"In other words, liars will burn in hell."
148;750600;751980;"Here is my question."
149;753220;755100;"Are you a plant?"
150;755100;755980;"No."
151;757400;758560;"What about you?"
152;758560;759730;"I am not."
153;761580;762740;"And you?"
154;763260;764490;"No."
155;767100;769020;"Are you a plant?"
156;770220;772250;"Yeah, that's right."
157;776080;779750;"Think carefully before you answer."
158;781790;783700;"Are you a plant?"
159;784460;786610;"Give me your answer!"
160;801300;803020;"My answer is yes."
161;809520;810850;"Impressive."
162;810850;812810;"I'll reward you with some information."
163;813320;814920;"My name is Squala."
164;814920;817290;"I don't have an official license,"
165;818370;822310;"but I'm a Hunter with Manipulator skills."
166;823930;825740;"I've used my Manipulator abilities"
167;825740;828290;"to instruct something to 
follow a certain order."
168;828290;830720;"You managed to unmask me,"
169;830720;834180;"but that doesn't mean you'll 
be able to escape alive..."
170;834600;837290;"What was the something, 
and what was the order?"
171;838440;841460;"This wouldn't be much of 
a test if I just told you."
172;841460;842540;"Fool."
173;843190;845690;"Even if you torture me, I won't talk."
174;846510;847280;"Huh?"
175;862030;865830;"This is my power, Instant Lover."
176;866230;868220;"I am also a Manipulator."
177;868780;872880;"Anyone I kiss becomes my slave."
178;874900;877640;"M-M-Mistress..."
179;881800;884580;"Take that, and that, and that. 
And that... And that!"
180;886130;886990;"More!"
181;886990;889850;"Please step on me more..."
182;890400;892240;"Now, answer my question!"
183;893030;896130;"What did you use your <i>Nen</i> on, 
and what was your command?"
184;896130;898300;"Talk, quickly."
185;898300;900000;"If you don't answer, I'll stop treading on you!"
186;901190;902990;"I'll talk! I'll talk!"
187;902990;906670;"I am just a l-lowly dog trainer..."
188;906670;908100;"That is..."
189;908100;909640;"A fearsome power."
190;911270;913920;"I used my <i>Nen</i> on the dogs"
191;913920;916270;"that run around this mansion."
192;916270;919990;"For example, the Maltese were told to nip"
193;919990;922050;"at a target's feet, to slow them."
194;922050;927260;"That's when the St. Bernard is to use 
its large body to smother the target."
195;927650;930970;"At the same time, the Dobermans will rush in"
196;930970;933030;"and finish off the target..."
197;933630;936180;"If the target still escapes, 
the bulldogs will—"
198;936180;937490;"That's enough..."
199;937490;939790;"Release the <i>Nen</i> you used on them!"
200;939790;941200;"A-At once!"
201;953880;958500;"So the dog tamer has been 
reduced to a pet, huh?"
202;958500;960020;"Don't say that..."
203;960020;962060;"I only did it to make him talk."
204;962680;966190;"If I wanted a man as a pet, 
I'd be more picky."
205;966990;968160;"That reminds me,"
206;968160;970260;"I never did catch your name."
207;970260;971450;"I'm Basho."
208;971840;974760;"As you've already seen, I'm a Conjurer."
209;975160;976640;"I am Baise."
210;976640;977890;"Melody."
211;978530;980640;"It appears you can hear heartbeats."
212;980640;982210;"What category do you fall into?"
213;982840;985960;"Well, I'm sure you'll find out soon enough."
214;987960;989710;"Playing coy, huh?"
215;991410;992470;"What about you?"
216;995920;998430;"I'd like to know your name."
217;998430;999780;"Would you tell us?"
218;1000390;1001360;"I refuse."
219;1002030;1004810;"We do not know if we'll 
be working together."
220;1006360;1008030;"Yeah, that's true."
221;1008030;1011240;"We cleared the first test, 
escaping the mansion,"
222;1011240;1013010;"but the real test has just begun."
223;1013010;1015940;"We must locate one of the designated items,"
224;1015940;1018370;"or we can't get the job."
225;1018760;1021030;"If we're all interested in this job,"
226;1021030;1023700;"we're bound to run into one other again."
227;1030240;1032450;"What is your opinion of this group?"
228;1032740;1035370;"This particular group looks promising."
229;1035790;1038350;"More promising than him, at least."
230;1041250;1043680;"I will not require him for a while."
231;1043680;1046020;"Put him away for now."
232;1047200;1049330;"I trust you can handle that, Squala."
233;1049330;1051070;"Y-Yes..."
234;1064180;1067270;"If I find one of the objects 
and earn the contract,"
235;1067620;1071280;"I will have passage to the 
Yorknew City auction."
236;1071280;1073800;"Yes, I absolutely must attend!"
237;1074580;1076990;"The Phantom Troupe will be there..."
238;1077510;1079010;"The band of thieves"
239;1079010;1082840;"that slaughtered my fellow Kurta."
240;1087900;1091660;"Our eyes burn a deep scarlet."
241;1093420;1098100;"Those thieves were willing to 
murder to obtain those eyes,"
242;1098100;1100790;"considered one of the world's 
top seven beautiful things."
243;1101110;1103080;"I will never forgive that act."
244;1106060;1107970;"I shall track them down"
245;1107970;1110110;"and utterly annihilate them!"
246;1139380;1142370;"Hmm, so this is <i>Greed Island</i>."
247;1143610;1148490;"Looks like the memory card that 
Kil found is the real deal."
248;1149490;1155130;"You can probably decipher the data 
and recreate the game, right?"
249;1156490;1157870;"You bet I can."
250;1158270;1161110;"I'll strip down the code, 
and clear the entire game."
251;1161430;1163100;"I'll put an end to the legend,"
252;1163100;1166140;"winning fifty billion Jenny in the process."
253;1166640;1167760;"Oh, right."
254;1167760;1169880;"This was a trade..."
255;1169880;1173900;"I have to tell Kil the URL for 
the Hunter-only website."
256;1181060;1183210;"If I break my end of the bargain,"
257;1183210;1187760;"he might start talking about breaking 
my precious figures again."
258;1202430;1204180;"There it is, Killua."
259;1204180;1207190;"Yeah, we're almost to Yorknew."
260;1207190;1210860;"We'll see Kurapika and Leorio there."
261;1210860;1212450;"I can't wait!"
262;1213000;1214450;"You're jumping the gun..."
263;1214450;1217190;"We still have two weeks before 
we're supposed to meet."
264;1217190;1218670;"Oh, you're right."
265;1219480;1223200;"It's been six months since we 
saw them, so I'm getting excited!"
266;1225610;1227260;"Six months ago, I'd never have dreamed"
267;1227260;1231210;"that we would come to Yorknew 
for a reason like this."
268;1231940;1232990;"Until we meet again."
269;1232990;1235080;"Yeah, that'll be..."
270;1235620;1238800;"September 1st, in Yorknew City."
271;1239890;1242670;"The auction begins on September 1st."
272;1242670;1246360;"We'll have to gather as much information
