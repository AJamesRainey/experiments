1;3190;4980;"Your technique"
2;5500;8980;"has two huge weaknesses!"
3;95990;100990;"Compassion x And x Strength"
4;102420;106510;"Gon has finally challenged 
Knuckle to a serious fight."
5;106510;111500;"However, Knuckle claims that 
Gon's technique has serious flaws."
6;116170;117550;"So, Gon..."
7;118780;122300;"What did you name that technique?"
8;122590;127010;"Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack."
9;128330;130170;"Ja-Janken!"
10;130170;132310;"Wow, zero effort..."
11;135110;137050;"Jajanken..."
12;137050;138910;"I understand."
13;138910;144200;"You combined "jajan" for "ta-dah," with 
"janken" for your attack, "Rock-Paper-Scissors.""
14;144510;146190;"Ah, no..."
15;147040;150080;"The first "ja" was a stutter."
16;151580;154620;"Not a bad name, kid!"
17;154620;156140;"Uh, yeah."
18;156140;157690;"Guess I'm okay with that."
19;157690;158840;"You are?!"
20;159210;164010;"Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses."
21;164580;166970;"First, it takes too long to charge."
22;168860;174360;"During a fight, you don't have time 
to stand still for several seconds."
23;174360;177780;"I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it."
24;177780;179240;"I know that."
25;179690;181860;"Second, it's too risky."
26;183510;188260;"When you focus aura in your 
fist to increase power,"
27;188260;190890;"you have less aura for defense."
28;190890;194750;"One attack to the wrong place 
will take you out, fool!"
29;195170;197320;"I know the risks."
30;197320;201760;"That's why I've spent the past month 
training to compensate for them!"
31;204760;208090;"Now that I see it again, 
his aura really is something."
32;208090;212150;"In terms of volume, he has 
as much as a mid-level pro."
33;212580;214020;"He's so close..."
34;217520;219690;"But you still lack"
35;221210;222780;"experience."
36;227060;228730;"You haven't been in"
37;230460;232290;"enough real fights!"
38;235500;237970;"You've got plenty of determination."
39;237970;240130;"It seems you've looked death 
in the eye many times,"
40;240130;242300;"and you have natural talent."
41;242580;245230;"However, you're still unrefined."
42;247370;249600;"Your aura is too rough!"
43;250850;253490;"I can tell which area you're defending."
44;253490;256030;"I can see what you're trying to do."
45;256770;259440;"Your aura gives it all away."
46;262300;266490;"So if I use that information to fake you out,"
47;269780;272450;"shifting your intended point of attack..."
48;283330;284500;"This is the result!"
49;288150;289310;"Damn..."
50;289310;292350;"His aura is giving away his every move!"
51;295570;298610;"I was right! Knuckle really is..."
52;300320;302030;"Okay, then..."
53;302730;305110;"Time to throw a real punch."
54;305730;306860;"He's so..."
55;307170;310140;"Don't blame me if you die."
56;311120;312870;"{\fad(1,683)}He's so gentle!"
57;313160;314480;"Behind you, fool!"
58;318760;321920;"Without his warning, I could have died."
59;323130;325970;"First, it takes too long to charge."
60;326940;328800;"He's teaching me when he doesn't have to..."
61;329350;331850;"And providing guidance."
62;333080;335860;"He's telling me how to become stronger."
63;339400;340860;"He's too gentle!"
64;345160;349060;"First comes rock..."
65;365360;368360;"I told you that you won't pull off that attack."
66;368360;369840;"Don't fool around with me!"
67;370810;373850;"That was your full strength?"
68;376320;378280;"Which one of us is fooling around?!"
69;379150;380850;"It's supposed to be a serious fight!"
70;381320;384360;"You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!"
71;387600;392700;"First comes rock..."
72;399030;400000;"Here I go!"
73;401440;402500;"Rock..."
74;407090;408100;"Over here!"
75;414550;416890;"First comes rock..."
76;417590;418390;"Rock..."
77;433700;435300;"Bastard..."
78;435300;438120;"He faked me out with his Jajanken."
79;439710;442770;"It's obvious that you're focused 
on stopping my special attack."
80;442770;447130;"Even I could tell exactly when your 
right arm was going to strike."
81;448410;452770;"He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long 
charge time, against his opponent."
82;453220;455470;"He's playing mind games."
83;457140;461910;"Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch."
84;461910;463630;"He has to swing for it."
85;463630;466770;"It's a perfect pitch, right down the 
middle, that he has to send flying."
86;467830;469280;"That's the trigger."
87;469810;472660;"When you see the easy ball, you tense up."
88;473720;475410;"You can hit it. You have to."
89;475970;479910;"These thoughts make you use 
more strength than necessary."
90;480500;482860;"The same thing applies to aura."
91;483340;485550;"<i>If a </i>Nen <i>user doesn't control their aura,</i>"
92;485550;487580;"it will gather in areas of tension."
93;487580;490440;"The moment of the swing, it intensifies further."
94;491630;495620;"<i>If the</i> Nen <i>user is inexperienced or out of control, </i>"
95;495620;499470;"the aura will either stagnate 
or just flow too freely."
96;500330;502160;"The flow of the aura"
97;502160;504310;"lets the opponent sense 
when an attack will come."
98;504930;507820;"You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!"
99;508280;511820;"By calling him out for being soft, 
Gon threw Knuckle off."
100;512100;514320;"As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out."
101;515220;519690;"I'd think this tactic would be more effective 
on those who know Jajanken's strength."
102;520540;524920;"Opponents who have seen how 
strong the technique can be"
103;524920;529180;"will be more scared and likely to lose 
control when they see it coming."
104;529880;532380;"The fake-out will be more believable,"
105;532380;533740;"and if the enemy steps back,"
106;533740;536230;"they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper."
107;538190;539470;"I always assumed Jajanken"
108;539470;542830;"would be less useful once opponents 
figured out how it works."
109;543450;545080;"That it was flawed."
110;546090;547300;"But I was wrong."
111;547300;549060;"It can be adapted to any situation."
112;549990;552360;"Okay, let's try this again."
113;552700;555400;"In the second attempt, he was 
too focused on the technique"
114;555400;557340;"and let Knuckle land a kick on him."
115;557340;561140;"But if he learns to better control his aura 
in response to the opponent's movement,"
116;561140;563970;"it will be harder to distinguish between"
117;563970;565500;"fake and real Jajanken attempts."
118;567280;571260;"Gon's been thinking how to shore 
up his technique's weaknesses."
119;575620;576630;"No..."
120;577530;580450;"He thought of the solution during this fight."
121;581620;586520;"He's making incredible progress while fighting."
122;591020;594740;"I'm already getting tired."
123;595080;597690;"We haven't even been 
fighting for twenty minutes."
124;598400;601800;"Moving so much is sapping my energy."
125;602380;606790;"If an hour of training is comparable 
to ten minutes of fighting,"
126;607240;610170;"<i>I'll only be able to maintain my </i>Ken <i>for another ten minutes.</i>"
127;611100;614890;"If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished."
128;615630;617170;"Before then, I have to end this."
129;618320;619680;"By using Jajanken."
130;623550;625810;"Bring it!"
131;636970;639680;"Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength."
132;640070;642950;"But Gon is adapting, little by little."
133;643570;646430;"By increasing the area his aura covers,"
134;646430;648590;"he reduces the damage from miscalculations."
135;649460;651680;"And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed."
136;652250;654620;"Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore."
137;655720;657460;"But he's running out of time."
138;658760;661970;"He doesn't have much stamina 
left to maintain his aura."
139;663180;666390;"On the other hand, Knuckle has 
been conserving his strength,"
140;666390;668480;"only attacking with physical blows."
141;669490;674600;"Jajanken requires a large 
amount of aura just to charge."
142;674600;677990;"A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount."
143;678520;681670;"Gon's already activated his technique three times."
144;683580;685960;"They started fighting twenty minutes ago."
145;686890;691300;"If he uses Jajanken again, 
he'll only have a minute or two"
146;691800;694160;"to fight at full strength."
147;708450;709540;"Gon..."
148;710160;712980;"You told me to use my full strength,"
149;712980;716110;"but you're no match for me right now."
150;717640;718690;"You're..."
151;719940;722360;"First comes"
152;723160;724700;"rock..."
153;727390;728200;"Why?"
154;729960;731020;"What..."
155;732520;733960;"is he going to do?"
156;741130;743500;"First comes"
157;744010;745600;"rock..."
158;749410;750670;"Why?"
159;750670;754480;"Knuckle's in good shape and alert, 
and he's attacking from that distance?"
160;754790;757980;"He isn't even going to hit Knuckle."
161;762640;766190;"This is definitely Gon's final attack."
162;766530;768370;"This will end it."
163;768740;772040;"Rock... Scissors..."
164;772040;775370;"Paper!"
165;780150;782050;"An Emitter attack?"
166;782630;786140;"But it's much weaker than his Rock."
167;787610;790390;"You're definitely an Enhancer."
168;791080;794020;"Your power as an Emitter is far lower."
169;794850;798050;"No speed... No punch."
170;798050;801900;"He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve."
171;802250;805150;"Once I knock that aside, it's over!"
172;808280;810740;"Once again!"
173;811470;812870;"Once again?"
174;814000;816370;"He used that ball as cover 
to move behind me?"
175;816710;818000;"Crap!"
176;818000;820350;"Two Jajankens in a row..."
177;821900;824880;"Rock!"
178;856360;861340;"He must have depleted his 
aura before Rock hit."
179;862370;866720;"Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground..."
180;874310;876310;"Where are you going, fool?"
181;876730;878240;"I'm going back."
182;878240;880220;"Aren't you going to fight?"
183;880220;881560;"I'm fine here."
184;882370;884810;"You can fight Gon again tomorrow."
185;885470;887810;"The outcome will probably be different."
186;888790;890660;"I'll defeat Shoot."
187;891820;893430;"Tell Gon this."
188;894210;897940;"Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real."
189;897940;900080;"He'd better be prepared to die."
190;900810;903610;"It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself."
191;904360;905590;"Sure you're up to the task?"
192;906020;907910;"Hell, yeah, fool."
193;908760;910050;"Tomorrow..."
194;912350;914420;"As long as you win,"
195;914420;915900;"it's fine if you don't get serious."
196;916940;921310;"But if you lose without fighting at full strength,"
197;921310;922100;"I won't forgive you."
198;925260;928010;"I'll never forgive you, as long as I live."
199;938160;941260;"You're still soft."
200;942360;945940;"Why are you helping the enemy?"
201;945940;949880;"And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well..."
202;949880;955140;"If you don't want to go to NGL, 
hand over your token to them."
203;955640;958930;"Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it."
204;959350;960800;"Bastard..."
205;961750;965620;"You're pretty cocky when you aren't 
shaking in your boots, eh?"
206;965620;970490;"The past month, all you've done is stalk them!"
207;970890;971900;"I'll fight."
208;972720;975860;"Tomorrow, I'll join the fight."
209;988860;990370;"Don't worry."
210;990370;992780;"I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight"
211;992780;994750;"in top condition tomorrow."
212;996110;998540;"Killua's the real issue..."
213;998540;999920;"I wasn't expecting him to go"
214;999920;1002870;"the whole month without fighting once."
215;1005220;1006260;"Killua!"
216;1009830;1011820;"Fight me."
217;1016320;1017150;"Huh?"
218;1019730;1022330;"What happened to your face, Killua?!"
219;1023450;1026080;"Huh? I was training with Bisky."
220;1026370;1028860;"Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?"
221;1028860;1032900;"Anyway, are you feeling okay?"
222;1032900;1034220;"Yep, I feel great."
223;1034610;1040060;"I used up all my aura, so I expected 
to be tired, but look!"
224;1040610;1042040;"That gorill—"
225;1042040;1045310;"That old hag's massage must have done the trick."
226;1046270;1047730;"That was close."
227;1048730;1050200;"Listen now..."
228;1050200;1052470;"If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,"
229;1052470;1054610;"I'll make your face three times worse."
230;1057740;1059240;"She wasn't joking."
231;1061080;1064650;"Now, do you know your weakness?"
232;1068750;1070750;"You're too quick to give up."
233;1072120;1074790;"You're too cautious about fighting."
234;1074790;1078380;"Some might say you underestimate yourself."
235;1079300;1082960;"When facing an enemy you 
believe to be stronger,"
236;1083900;1086880;"you fight on the premise of escaping."
237;1091490;1095090;"I realize that this isn't your fault."
238;1095090;1098720;"It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight."
239;1105700;1110470;"Habits that are burned into your 
body and soul aren't easy to break."
240;1111990;1114050;"But I can say one thing for sure."
241;1116440;1120050;"Somewhere down the line, 
you'll leave Gon behind to die."
242;1125610;1127360;"Combat ability can change,"
243;1127360;1130560;"depending on environment 
and physical condition."
244;1130560;1132620;"For example, a good-condition C"
245;1132620;1135190;"has a high chance of defeating 
a poor-condition D."
246;1136170;1139950;"If the conditions are right, A, B, and C"
247;1139950;1142920;"all have the potential to defeat D."
248;1143370;1145700;"But in your case, you're assuming"
249;1146540;1148970;"the enemy is always at their best."
250;1148970;1152260;"You always assume the worst-case scenario."
251;1155330;1157770;"Even when facing enemies with equal strength,"
252;1157770;1161800;"you worry about how strong they are, 
or what they might do to you."
253;1162650;1166210;"If we're talking about a stronger 
enemy, there's no question..."
254;1166210;1169730;"You don't bother to think of how you could win."
255;1170250;1173530;"Running is your only option. 
That's how losers think."
256;1174990;1178070;"Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself"
257;1178070;1183740;"to face enemies stronger than 
you will take determination."
258;1184710;1189540;"If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,"
259;1191210;1193350;"you must leave Gon's side."
260;1198060;1200760;"Okay! I'm gonna win this time!"
261;1215790;1216880;"Let's go."
262;1217370;1218530;"Yeah."
263;1227370;1234330;"Killua's overly cautious style is the 
product of a smothering love."
264;1238050;1240720;"A twisted, self-serving love..."
265;1241800;1246320;"That just makes his habits stronger, 
deeper, and harder to break."
266;1246820;1250950;"Without extraordinary willpower, 
this curse cannot be broken."
267;1265430;1270230;"I don't know who will emerge victorious..."
268;1272020;1273330;"All right, then..."
