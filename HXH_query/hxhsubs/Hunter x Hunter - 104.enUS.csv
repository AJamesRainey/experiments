1;2340;5230;"How many are there?"
2;5420;7250;"Around five thousand."
3;7250;10730;"And that's a fifth of what they were expecting."
4;10730;13600;"The King must be angry about that."
5;13600;14710;"No..."
6;14710;17360;"Apparently, he's been playing games in his room."
7;17360;20740;"He's so obsessed with Gungi, 
he's been skipping meals."
8;20740;23140;"Then what about all this food?"
9;23140;24940;"Should we take it for ourselves?"
10;24940;27890;"You want to take on the King 
and his Royal Guard?"
11;27890;29620;"Don't make me laugh."
12;29950;31130;"Yeah..."
13;31130;35520;"Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone 
is until you have enough strength yourself."
14;35520;38690;"They're monsters. I'll do as they say."
15;39020;41570;"When Shaia-dono gave us our powers,"
16;41570;44820;"he'd probably anticipated that 
things would turn out this way."
17;44820;46990;"Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!"
18;48120;50770;"If you call him by his old name, he gets mad."
19;131980;136990;"Doubt x And x Hesitation"
20;145470;148310;"The suit with the glasses is keeping 
a careful watch on his surroundings"
21;148310;150000;"while heading toward the palace."
22;150440;152860;"The puppets are useless against him."
23;152860;154520;"He's strong."
24;154520;156010;"What about his abilities?"
25;156460;161050;"Like the others, he has used 
only physical attacks thus far."
26;161050;164390;"Okay, let me know if he shows his power."
27;166720;170700;"Once Welfin and Brovada arrive, 
we'll take care of those figures in white."
28;172010;174400;"I can also check out the 
powers those two have."
29;180930;182770;"Damn, I lost sight of him!"
30;183280;188660;"Leol-sama, it appears that the suit 
with glasses is able to teleport."
31;192950;196310;"Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek."
32;195860;198290;"Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex 
Hide and Seek"
33;196310;198300;"It allows him to teleport."
34;199670;205810;"By placing a hand against a wall or the ground, 
he can open a portal to access <i>Nen</i> space."
35;206260;210470;"He is able to transport people 
and objects through that portal."
36;211550;217310;"Hide and Seek creates a <i>Nen</i> space of 
twenty-one rooms, on four floors."
37;217970;221340;"Each room is isolated."
38;221340;224720;"The entrance shuts when anyone enters,"
39;225070;229950;"so to return to the real world, 
one must exit by a different door."
40;230490;233450;"It is possible to create multiple entrances."
41;233760;236670;"The number of possible entrances differs 
depending on the size of the room."
42;237080;240150;"The exit leads back to the portal used for entry."
43;240640;246790;"So, as a general rule, one can only enter 
and exit via the location of the entry portal."
44;247600;250280;"However, using Knov's master key,"
45;250850;254870;"an exit can be linked to any portal."
46;266470;267860;"Nothing out of place."
47;268260;270120;"Still quiet on the battlefront."
48;271130;275370;"Morel's Deep Purple is used for 
primarily defensive purposes."
49;275760;279960;"If a puppet encounters someone who 
isn't an ally, it will keep its distance."
50;279960;283560;"If it comes under attack, it will 
retreat, while fighting back."
51;284450;290180;"The puppets fight back by throwing 
nearby objects at the enemy."
52;290820;293380;"They avoid direct contact,"
53;293380;298770;"so the enemy won't realize 
they are <i>Nen</i> puppets."
54;300530;303030;"That's a Chimera..."
55;303710;304810;"What is it doing?"
56;305340;308390;"We're pretty far from the battlefield."
57;308890;309780;"Is it scouting the area?"
58;312150;315350;"There were strange dragonflies around town."
59;315350;319790;"I thought they were a local species, 
but might they be created from his </i>Nen<i>?"
60;320510;321800;"It's very likely..."
61;322650;327050;"If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in 
gathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!"
62;327710;328500;"The battle is on."
63;336260;339020;"Hey... Hey!"
64;340890;343210;"Aren't you gonna touch me?"
65;344040;346800;"Look how close I am..."
66;346800;348320;"I know you're awake."
67;350020;351090;"Whoa, there!"
68;352620;354330;"I knew you were faking it."
69;354330;356080;"You can't trick me!"
70;356490;359160;"With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!"
71;359160;361090;"Give me some peace and quiet!"
72;362790;364020;"No way!"
73;364020;365940;"I won't let you get any sleep!"
74;365940;368610;"I'll keep making noise until you chase me!"
75;368930;370330;"Idiot..."
76;370330;373800;"If that's what you wanted, 
you should have set a rule"
77;373800;376160;"to force people to keep chasing you."
78;376790;380690;"Looks like he's still getting 
used to his new power..."
79;381460;382910;"Have it your way."
80;382910;385480;"I won't be getting up for the next five hours."
81;388430;391490;"He's really focused on making 
this a contest of speed."
82;392570;396240;"Coupled with his constant need for attention,"
83;396240;399330;"it's unlikely that he'll settle for 
any other type of contest."
84;401270;404000;"I'm not gonna let you sleep!"
85;404530;405870;"Hey! Over here!"
86;405870;407540;"I'm within reach..."
87;407540;408510;"Get up!"
88;408910;410800;"Look how close I am."
89;410800;412330;"It's just a waiting game."
90;412650;416580;"If he gives up and moves away..."
91;418210;419770;"I win."
92;442130;444250;"9-9-1, marshal."
93;445940;448010;"1-5-1, marshal."
94;449260;451510;"7-9-1, pawn."
95;452760;455010;"2-3-1, pawn."
96;456080;458430;"8-1-1, spy."
97;459490;462020;"2-3-1, cannon."
98;462670;464770;"9-1-1, fortress."
99;465980;467780;"2-7-2, musketeer."
100;469410;471060;"The marshal has been isolated..."
101;472670;475550;"I'll call this "remote concealment.""
102;476480;478660;"7-1-2, fortress."
103;479950;482160;"1-6-2, general."
104;483370;485470;"9-1-3, archer."
105;486440;488730;"3-2-2, major general."
106;489620;490560;"I'm done."
107;491350;493790;"Her initial placement was exactly as expected."
108;494340;498430;"She's shifting toward my marshal 
without breaking her crane formation."
109;499210;501320;"Let us begin, then."
110;502120;504690;"Her first move will be to position 
her archer on her right flank."
111;504690;508340;"She'll probably try a three-pronged 
attack to end it quickly."
112;508340;513420;"But shifting her pieces to the right 
exposes her left flank to attack."
113;515770;518650;"It's time to disrupt your rhythm."
114;522590;524830;"1-9-3, new archer."
115;525390;526330;"There it is."
116;527670;530010;"9-7-1, new spy."
117;532230;534430;"2-9-1, knight."
118;534820;537630;"Her three-pronged attack 
and left flank movement"
119;537630;539930;"will cost me two pieces."
120;540580;543940;"But that created an opening in her left flank."
121;543940;547290;"She'll probably expect me to 
go all-in from that side."
122;548300;549340;"But I won't!"
123;549860;550740;"Here it is!"
124;553090;555270;"5-5-1, lieutenant general."
125;563930;567280;"Each of her moves has followed 
a set rhythm until just now,"
126;567760;569460;"when she froze."
127;569810;571210;"Given the current placement,"
128;571570;574190;"I can attack through the 
center in unlimited ways."
129;575140;576310;"There is no best move."
130;577010;580610;"With every turn, I have the 
ability to extend the match."
131;581890;583570;"Now, let me hear you"
132;584380;586000;"squeal!"
133;604970;607500;"9-2-1, new lieutenant general."
134;619020;620260;"That's checkmate."
135;622560;626520;"You knew my strategy was a dead end."
136;624350;626520;"{\fad(358,1)}Dead End"
137;627780;628520;"Yes."
138;628760;631780;"Why did you need to think 
before making your move?"
139;632250;634560;"You could have made that move at once."
140;635710;637810;"The King has moved this match off the board."
141;638210;639910;"A wrong answer could mean"
142;640810;642410;"her death."
143;644340;648120;"Your "remote concealment" strategy"
144;648120;651070;"is actually named "kokoriko.""
145;652250;654420;"I came up with that strategy..."
146;655630;657670;"ten years ago."
147;659650;661790;"Placing the lieutenant general in the center"
148;661790;666660;"to counter a three-pronged attack is also a
 move I devised, called "general in the middle.""
149;667100;669510;"At the time, both drew a lot of attention."
150;670000;674720;"Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle 
was a popular transition that tested"
151;674720;677870;"both players' ability to read their opponents."
152;678960;681690;"I was pretty happy"
153;681690;687220;"that a fool like me could figure 
out a smart strategy..."
154;688450;690960;"But then, I saw how to defeat it."
155;692790;695430;"A year after I came up with kokoriko,"
156;695430;700080;"an opponent used it against me 
in the national tournament,"
157;700080;702470;"and I figured out how to counter it."
158;703480;705590;"I won the match,"
159;705590;710410;"but the strategy disappeared from 
official matches and textbooks."
160;711460;716250;"That the Supreme Leader thought 
of the same strategy as I had..."
161;716250;721790;"I was so honored, and touched...
My heart trembled."
162;722990;724030;"It felt like..."
163;728270;732000;"Like seeing my child brought back to life."
164;733860;735650;"That was how it felt."
165;736620;742610;"So it was difficult for me 
to take that life again."
166;745510;746740;"That was why"
167;747240;748670;"I hesitated."
168;757980;759020;"Foolishness."
169;759370;761020;"I've had enough."
170;761020;762340;"Get some rest."
171;765790;767330;"Once we begin again,"
172;768940;771120;"you won't get any more breaks."
173;771120;772290;"Be prepared!"
174;773140;774850;"Y-Yes..."
175;778600;780120;"I believe this is"
176;780120;785290;"the first time the King has ever listened 
to anyone speak for such a long time."
177;786000;786800;"Well,"
178;787530;789230;"it should have no significance..."
179;792760;794810;"Four hours have passed?"
180;798140;800740;"He got bored and started reading..."
181;800740;803070;"That guy's too easy to understand."
182;807590;809240;"Oh, you're ready to start?"
183;809240;811070;"Has it already been five hours?"
184;811070;813480;"Wait, it's only half full."
185;814280;816050;"Are you getting worried?"
186;822330;823840;"You just noticed?"
187;824310;825850;"We aren't starting now."
188;825850;827100;"It's already over."
189;827800;829850;"Look at your ankle."
190;832790;835100;"A rope of smoke?"
191;835320;837600;"That took a lot of effort..."
192;838290;841830;"I had to go all the way around 
so you wouldn't notice,"
193;841830;844610;"so it turned into quite a long rope."
194;846180;849730;"In any case, all that's left 
is to wind up the rope."
195;851010;852870;"Now it's only a matter of time."
196;861350;864380;"Your turn to try whatever you can."
197;864380;865460;"But it won't work."
198;872070;874700;"You should take the smoke seriously."
199;874700;877310;"Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed."
200;878200;879930;"You can struggle all you want."
201;889260;890710;"I knew it..."
202;891260;895560;"He won't attack me because 
this is a game of tag."
203;896110;900900;"If I touch his body, it will break his ability."
204;901610;906820;"He has no patience, but he chose 
for the game to last eight hours."
205;906820;909590;"I'm not the one you're putting pressure on."
206;910280;911920;"The pressure's on you."
207;913440;916350;"Cheetu's power was still a work in progress."
208;916880;922290;"With his back against the wall, 
desperate for a way out..."
209;924120;926360;"He created a new ability."
210;934410;935990;"A crossbow and claws."
211;937240;941090;"He can fight at any range."
212;943200;944560;"Thanks!"
213;944560;947990;"You helped me gain an awesome new power!"
214;949010;951860;"Hey, do you know what this is?"
215;951860;953010;"It's a bow. A bow!"
216;954720;956850;"You sure you want to come closer?!"
217;957600;958520;"There!"
218;960070;961270;"I'm quite sure."
219;963030;968530;"Why would you want a power 
that's slower than you are?"
220;969400;970280;"Ah."
221;970580;973290;"Why don't you try those claws?"
222;973290;976260;"Then I won't have to walk over."
223;977180;979290;"I'll tell you why you lost."
224;979710;981040;"It's because"
225;982220;983770;"you're an idiot."
226;995230;996330;"Die!"
227;996330;998890;"Then you can never touch me!"
228;1000390;1002100;"This sensation..."
229;1003370;1004200;"It can't be..."
230;1005120;1006150;"Smoke?"
231;1007200;1008270;"No way!"
232;1009960;1011990;"Caught you."
233;1013130;1015060;"Wh-When did you..."
234;1016160;1019790;"While you were reading manga 
and laughing like a fool,"
235;1020570;1025000;"I created a copy of myself from smoke."
236;1025000;1028190;"And I covered myself with smoke 
that looked like grass."
237;1028620;1031300;"My copy went one way, and I went the other."
238;1031300;1033900;"The fight continues, even while one sleeps."
239;1033900;1036680;"You shouldn't have looked away."
240;1039260;1041120;"Looks like we're back..."
241;1041520;1043430;"Well, do you still want to fight?"
242;1045820;1047870;"No, I've had enough."
243;1048740;1050940;"That's a wise decision..."
244;1051250;1054610;"Then why not tell me"
245;1054610;1059510;"what would have happened 
if I hadn't caught you?"
246;1059850;1061720;"There's no point in asking."
247;1061720;1065940;"Once I've been caught, 
I can't use that power anymore."
248;1065940;1068430;"That was the condition I set."
249;1068430;1070960;"Really? I feel bad..."
250;1072160;1073860;"It's no big deal."
251;1073860;1076980;"I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!"
252;1076980;1079250;"Next time, I won't lose."
253;1079250;1080880;"You'd better be ready!"
254;1081300;1082970;"His superior"
255;1083810;1087040;"is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia,"
256;1087040;1090730;"<i>who has the power to release</i> Nen <i>skills.</i>"
257;1091330;1096080;"So if the selection is carried out, 
winning will become very difficult."
258;1096610;1100490;"Gon and Killua made the right choice."
259;1101320;1102470;"We need to meet."
260;1102470;1103610;"Let's talk inside."
261;1105480;1106860;"Reinforcements have arrived."
262;1106860;1108630;"It's a crayfish and a wolf."
263;1108630;1109930;"Are they strong?"
264;1109930;1112000;"If I knew, my job would be easier..."
265;1112460;1115510;"Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength."
266;1115910;1117660;"So it's currently a stalemate."
267;1117660;1121250;"Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out."
268;1121250;1124140;"I suspect it's because I took out this one."
269;1125340;1128910;"Those dragonflies were acting 
as security cameras."
270;1129470;1131330;"Come in, Flutter!"
271;1132890;1135180;"Doesn't seem he's going to show."
272;1135180;1136900;"Change in plans!"
273;1137250;1140480;"Without Flutter, we have no way 
to know the enemy's location."
274;1140480;1141320;"Damn."
275;1141930;1144280;"When it really counts, he lets me down!"
276;1144720;1146300;"Should I call it off?"
277;1146300;1147290;"No, I can't do that."
278;1147990;1151290;"I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!"
279;1151290;1153170;"We're heading back, then."
280;1153630;1155100;"Ah, hold on..."
281;1155840;1158170;"It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it."
282;1159200;1161670;"Rental Pod
IOU Dispenser"
283;1161960;1163930;"Is that your power?"
284;1164280;1166380;"Yeah, I can use it to scout around."
285;1166380;1168020;"Don't tell anyone else..."
286;1168020;1169950;"I'm showing you because I trust you."
287;1170420;1173370;"Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth."
288;1174080;1177440;"Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily"
289;1177440;1184050;"borrow an ability in exchange 
for granting the target a favor."
290;1184050;1186870;"However, two conditions must be met."
291;1187260;1188250;"First,"
292;1188250;1192350;"he must have seen the ability or know its name."
293;1189770;1191710;"{\fad(211,1)}Satellite Dragonflies"
294;1192570;1195590;"Second, he must grant a favor."
295;1195590;1200050;"After confirming that his favor is not 
free and is expected to be repaid,"
296;1200050;1205580;"this skill will activate, assuming 
the target agrees to his conditions."
297;1205580;1206210;"Got it!"
298;1206820;1212720;"Once all conditions are met, Leol's 
dispenser automatically stores data,"
299;1212720;1215070;"which can be checked at any time."
300;1215590;1220480;"However, if the target dies, 
the data will be deleted."
301;1221150;1222590;"Flutter's fine."
302;1223860;1226880;"I believe there's been no communication"
303;1226880;1228910;"because he's unconscious or far away."
304;1229250;1231500;"A rental can be used for one hour."
305;1231500;1235420;"During the rental period, the target 
cannot use the borrowed power."
306;1235950;1238080;"Anyway, Flutter is still alive..."
307;1238660;1240580;"Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch."
308;1240580;1242120;"Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies"
309;1242120;1245110;"verify the location of the suit 
with the glasses, we'll start."
310;1245580;1250130;"So we keep the small fry at a distance 
while you take on the suit with the glasses."
311;1250580;1252430;"You gonna be okay on your own?"
312;1252430;1256070;"Just trust me. I wouldn't give 
you a job you can't handle."
313;1258110;1261970;"And I don't want you to see my power."
314;1262830;1266140;"I'll do whatever it takes to 
complete this mission."
315;1267000;1268540;"Okay..."
316;1269720;1272220;"I can't afford to wait around here."
317;1272920;1275460;"Not until the King is in my debt!"
318;1275780;1280380;"When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and 
tears it up, the effect activates."
319;1282560;1283750;"They're here."
320;1285210;1286790;"Time to start scouting."
321;1291600;1292690;"I don't understand."
322;1294460;1295590;"This is upsetting."
323;1296190;1299770;"During our matches, I am the only 
one who's getting flustered."
324;1301190;1305560;"I would have expected this to be 
humiliating on a new level."
325;1306330;1307490;"But..."
326;1308450;1313260;"At the same time, I am enjoying our matches."
327;1315640;1319210;"But I don't understand why..."
328;1404740;1407340;"Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening."
329;1407340;1410380;"Morel-san, what's in your pipe?"
330;1410380;1411480;"It holds..."
331;1411480;1412590;"Gulp."
332;1412590;1413730;"...tonkotsu."
